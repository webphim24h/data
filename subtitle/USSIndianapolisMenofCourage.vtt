This asshole wanted

and he doesn't know how to swim.

how old the ship is?

0:26:42.885 --> 0:26:45.507
It's 13 years old.
13 is an unlucky number.

We have the unlucky privilege
of carrying God knows what

0:26:50.630 --> 0:26:54.659
with no protection
across the ocean.

0:26:54.694 --> 0:26:57.954

because if you go in the drink,

here... the sharks will.

by some evolutionary accident,

0:27:19.237 --> 0:27:23.555
we developed these big brains,
and we invented weapons.

0:27:23.590 --> 0:27:26.243
So we got used to being
at the top of the food chain,

0:27:26.278 --> 0:27:29.602
but once you step
in that saltwater,

0:27:29.637 --> 0:27:32.482
right back to the bottom
of the food chain.

0:27:32.517 --> 0:27:36.515
Even if you swim well,
we look pathetic to sharks.

0:27:36.550 --> 0:27:40.706
They think were wounded,
split up the middle, you know?

0:27:40.741 --> 0:27:44.547
