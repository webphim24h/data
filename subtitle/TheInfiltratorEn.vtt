0:02:20.320 --> 0:02:21.799
My favorite waitress.

0:02:22.040 --> 0:02:23.536
Ah, you say that to every waitress.

0:02:23.560 --> 0:02:25.312
Oh, no, no, no, you are.

0:02:27.240 --> 0:02:28.389
Thanks.

0:02:29.520 --> 0:02:33.308
Hey, you know, the last guy that paid me,
he paid me with a gram.

0:02:33.440 --> 0:02:35.078
- A gram? Jesus...
- A gram.

0:02:35.240 --> 0:02:36.240
This guy, he told me...

0:02:36.280 --> 0:02:37.280
I know, right?

0:02:37.360 --> 0:02:39.954
He told me that
he didn't carry money anymore

0:02:40.040 --> 0:02:41.837
because money was old-fashioned.

0:02:41.920 --> 0:02:44.016
- Really? Call me old-fashioned then.
- Old-fashioned.

0:02:44.040 --> 0:02:45.314
Call me old-fashioned?

0:02:45.400 --> 0:02:48.312
This guy says that...
He said that money was done.

0:02:48.920 --> 0:02:50.720
- Yeah.
- And that what we needed was a new...

0:02:52.600 --> 0:02:54.280
- Oh, fuck, what's that word?
- A new what?

0:02:54.440 --> 0:02:56.112
Like a new...

0:02:57.080 --> 0:03:00.436
- Like a, you know... Come on.
- Oh, I know. No, I know what you mean.

0:03:00.680 --> 0:03:03.080
- But you're so cute when you struggle.
- Come on.

0:03:03.240 --> 0:03:05.674
What we need is a new currency.

0:03:06.200 --> 0:03:07.553
- Right?
- Shit.

0:03:08.400 --> 0:03:10.391
Yeah, that's what he said.
I liked that guy.

0:03:10.480 --> 0:03:11.549
I bet you did.

0:03:13.880 --> 0:03:15.950
- I can't have that.
- Not right now.

0:03:16.200 --> 0:03:17.200
Maybe later.

0:03:18.120 --> 0:03:20.315
I'll come find you later.
I'm gonna keep your 20.

0:03:20.400 --> 0:03:21.799
Keep the 20, that's for you, doll.

0:03:22.800 --> 0:03:24.995
Now I am gonna watch you wiggle away.

0:03:25.360 --> 0:03:27.032
Wiggle away.

0:03:29.640 --> 0:03:31.676
Hey, keep your eyes off my girlfriend.

0:03:33.880 --> 0:03:37.350
Hey, you believe I bowled a 240
in Monday's league?

0:03:37.880 --> 0:03:40.474
Bowling. Mi fa cagare!

0:03:41.000 --> 0:03:42.035
Yeah.

0:03:43.160 --> 0:03:45.390
You know, my people say
they can handle more.

0:03:48.480 --> 0:03:50.789
That's just what my people like to hear.

0:03:52.280 --> 0:03:53.599
How's 10 keys?

0:03:55.680 --> 0:03:57.830
- It's not too heavy for me.
- Great.

0:04:03.440 --> 0:04:05.795
Hey, let's get the fuck out of here.

0:04:06.160 --> 0:04:08.833
Yeah. It stinks like something's burning.

0:04:09.760 --> 0:04:11.079
Jesus.

0:04:11.840 --> 0:04:13.319
- Jesus. God.
- What?

0:04:14.000 --> 0:04:15.831
- What is it?
- No, no, it's all right.

0:04:16.360 --> 0:04:17.376
- It's all right. I just...
- You're all right?

0:04:17.400 --> 0:04:21.109
It's like indigestion, or my gallbladder,
or something. It's all right.

0:04:22.720 --> 0:04:24.950
You think I wanna
count 40 grand in ones, Mangione?

0:04:25.360 --> 0:04:27.749
What, do I look like a banker to you?
It's all there.

0:04:28.000 --> 0:04:29.513
Man, I swear something is burning.

0:04:30.400 --> 0:04:31.549
What the fuck?

0:04:31.800 --> 0:04:33.711
- Shit. Come on.
- No, no, no.

0:04:34.840 --> 0:04:37.354
- It's like my appendix burst or something...
- Fuck.

0:04:37.560 --> 0:04:39.710
Let me get you out of here. Come on.

0:04:47.200 --> 0:04:49.216
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground!

0:04:49.240 --> 0:04:51.310
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground now!

0:04:51.640 --> 0:04:52.834
Let's go! Now!

0:04:52.920 --> 0:04:54.717
Get your fucking hands off me!

0:04:55.560 --> 0:04:56.920
Let's go, let's go.

0:04:57.200 --> 0:04:59.794
Hey, don't worry, Bob.
Our people will get us out of this.

0:05:02.720 --> 0:05:03.720
Shut it. Shut it.

0:05:04.240 --> 0:05:05.593
You okay? You all right?

0:05:06.280 --> 0:05:07.280
Come on.

0:05:09.880 --> 0:05:11.108
Holy shit.

0:05:12.720 --> 0:05:14.358
Okay, let's go, let's go.

0:06:25.080 --> 0:06:26.593
- Hey.
- Hey.

0:06:27.560 --> 0:06:28.959
What are you doing up?

0:06:30.320 --> 0:06:31.639
Couldn't sleep.

0:06:32.200 --> 0:06:33.997
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

0:06:37.040 --> 0:06:40.191
- Did it go okay?
- Oh, yeah. Piece of cake.

0:06:49.120 --> 0:06:50.314
So,

0:06:52.120 --> 0:06:53.917
is Bob Mangione dead?

0:06:54.000 --> 0:06:55.399
Oh...

0:06:55.480 --> 0:06:58.313
He's dead, all right. Deep fried.

0:07:13.680 --> 0:07:16.592
So, my niece and nephew,
are they good?

0:07:17.080 --> 0:07:18.559
Look at them. They're good.

0:07:18.840 --> 0:07:23.072
Yeah, yeah. That's good.
Because kids need a lot, you know.

0:07:23.160 --> 0:07:24.639
Tell me about it.

0:07:26.000 --> 0:07:28.594
So, Bobby, tell me.

0:07:29.320 --> 0:07:30.514
What?

0:07:30.880 --> 0:07:32.029
How much you get?

0:07:34.040 --> 0:07:35.040
Come on.

0:07:35.320 --> 0:07:38.551
Aunt Vicky, we have been through this.
I work for the government.

0:07:39.080 --> 0:07:40.672
You don't get a piece of the action?

0:07:40.760 --> 0:07:42.432
No. A piece of the action?

0:07:42.560 --> 0:07:45.154
- What, 10, 20%?
- No, not a dime.

0:07:47.360 --> 0:07:49.191
Ah... And they call us criminals.

0:07:49.880 --> 0:07:52.758
Eh. You should have stayed
with the accounting.

0:07:52.840 --> 0:07:54.512
You could have cooked your uncle's books.

0:07:54.880 --> 0:07:56.871
You could have owned this place by now.

0:07:57.240 --> 0:08:00.277
Everyone needs a beachfront address.
I got six of them.

0:08:00.360 --> 0:08:02.555
Yeah, well,
I just don't live in your world.

0:08:04.280 --> 0:08:05.679
I'm afraid you do.

0:08:06.920 --> 0:08:08.558
A little advice, Bobby?

0:08:11.000 --> 0:08:12.069
Yeah, sure.

0:08:13.560 --> 0:08:15.391
When your Uncle Al died,

0:08:15.480 --> 0:08:18.790
I didn't become a little old bag lady
in a bag dress.

0:08:18.880 --> 0:08:22.395
No, no, no, I pulled myself up,

0:08:23.000 --> 0:08:24.831
carried on in his name,

0:08:24.920 --> 0:08:27.753
even when I didn't have enough
to buy a loaf of bread.

0:08:28.080 --> 0:08:29.672
No one knew nothing.

0:08:30.320 --> 0:08:33.835
I didn't have a pot to piss in,
but I had a Caddy,

0:08:33.920 --> 0:08:37.993
20 Chanel suits, diamonds up my throat,

0:08:38.440 --> 0:08:40.431
and season tickets to the Giants.

0:08:41.560 --> 0:08:45.235
And nobody was giving me nothing.

0:08:45.400 --> 0:08:47.550
- Nobody.
- Aunt Vicky, what do you want from me?

0:08:48.960 --> 0:08:50.791
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

0:08:51.440 --> 0:08:52.668
Please, dear.

0:08:54.440 --> 0:08:56.237
Don't be Bobby Loser.

0:08:58.720 --> 0:09:00.756
Be Bobby Somebody.

0:09:06.960 --> 0:09:09.633
Listen up. It's bad out there,
so a couple of team changes.

0:09:09.720 --> 0:09:12.109
Peters, you're with Sanchez.
Mazur, you're with Abreu.

0:09:12.280 --> 0:09:13.280
What about Cooky?

0:09:13.320 --> 0:09:16.200
You'll still report to Steve,
but he'll ride the desk on this one.

0:09:16.320 --> 0:09:17.320
Hit the lights.

0:09:18.760 --> 0:09:19.760
Lights!

0:09:21.600 --> 0:09:25.388
When I say bad, I mean the County Morgue had
to rent Burger King's refrigerated trucks

0:09:25.480 --> 0:09:28.472
to ice all the dead bodies
littering our sunny streets.

0:09:28.880 --> 0:09:31.633
Score. Cartel 100, Customs zero.

0:09:32.400 --> 0:09:35.153
Meet with your connects,
talk to your informants, do your job.

0:09:36.040 --> 0:09:37.792
All right, out, out, out. Everybody out.

0:09:38.040 --> 0:09:39.136
You understand me?

0:09:39.160 --> 0:09:41.355
Before I go to jail,
I swear on my fucking kids,

0:09:41.440 --> 0:09:42.640
I'm gonna put someone on Jeff.

0:09:42.720 --> 0:09:44.915
You tell Jeff to meet me
at his father's development.

0:09:45.000 --> 0:09:46.274
We'll go in the big pool.

0:09:46.360 --> 0:09:47.360
And I'm gonna go in naked

0:09:47.480 --> 0:09:49.256
so he doesn't have to worry
about me having a gun.

0:09:49.280 --> 0:09:51.200
'Cause I'm gonna bite
the motherfucker's cock off

0:09:51.280 --> 0:09:54.160
- and I'm gonna spit it in his wife's mouth.
- Enough. Enough.

0:09:54.440 --> 0:09:56.816
Bond denied. Take him away.

0:09:59.440 --> 0:10:00.998
Hey, fuck you, buddy.

0:10:01.120 --> 0:10:02.678
Huh?

0:10:04.280 --> 0:10:06.669
Order. Take him away.

0:10:06.800 --> 0:10:08.756
- Get the fuck off me.
- Mr. Myers...

0:10:08.840 --> 0:10:10.336
I wonder what Sunday dinner
is like at his place.

0:10:10.360 --> 0:10:13.616
Advise your client that if there's
another outburst like this, he's going to...

0:10:13.640 --> 0:10:14.993
I need to tell you

0:10:15.080 --> 0:10:18.390
because of your wound, you're eligible
for retirement with full benefits.

0:10:19.880 --> 0:10:21.518
I'd hate to lose you, Bob.

0:10:24.200 --> 0:10:27.875
Once your children
walk out the door, they're on their own.

0:10:28.760 --> 0:10:29.909
Say no...

0:10:30.560 --> 0:10:34.030
Uh-huh. Huh...
Okay. Uh, Colonel Mustard, in the library...

0:10:34.200 --> 0:10:36.720
- He's always the guy.
- Do you want some reefer?

0:10:37.240 --> 0:10:38.992
- Four.
- It'll make you feel good.

0:10:40.000 --> 0:10:41.035
No, no, no.

0:10:48.160 --> 0:10:49.536
Hello? Hello?

0:10:49.560 --> 0:10:51.869
Help your children to just say no.

0:10:51.960 --> 0:10:54.918
Hello? Anybody home?
I'm not a Jehovah's.

0:10:55.080 --> 0:10:56.308
Hey, Mrs. Mazur, pardon.

0:10:56.400 --> 0:10:58.456
- I'm sorry, but I'm with Customs.
- Stay here. No, no, it's okay.

0:10:58.480 --> 0:10:59.576
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

0:10:59.600 --> 0:11:00.696
We're gonna have a little chat outside.

0:11:00.720 --> 0:11:02.336
- Why don't you finish the game?
- Okay. It's kind of cold.

0:11:02.360 --> 0:11:04.096
I'll be in in a minute.
It's all right. We're fine.

0:11:04.120 --> 0:11:05.776
Carry on.
Andrea, take your time, okay.

0:11:05.800 --> 0:11:08.056
- You know, we have a front door.
- Well, then answer it, bro.

0:11:08.080 --> 0:11:10.056
Just because we don't answer,
doesn't mean you can just...

0:11:10.080 --> 0:11:12.416
- I was knocking for 20 minutes.
- ...if I don't wanna answer my door.

0:11:12.440 --> 0:11:15.750
- I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry. How about if we...
- No, no. We're not going inside.

0:11:15.920 --> 0:11:16.920
What do you want?

0:11:17.120 --> 0:11:18.439
Well, hey.

0:11:20.200 --> 0:11:22.760
- Tea, gentlemen?
- Ah. Bendita, it's so kind of you.

0:11:22.880 --> 0:11:24.896
I don't get invited to
too many houses with a wife and tea.

0:11:24.920 --> 0:11:25.920
You weren't invited.

0:11:26.000 --> 0:11:28.256
More like coke, whores and Schlitz,
you know what I'm saying?

0:11:28.280 --> 0:11:30.430
- Right.
- What is this, Darjeeling?

0:11:30.760 --> 0:11:33.041
- I'll be in in a second. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

0:11:35.560 --> 0:11:36.629
All right, bro, check it.

0:11:36.720 --> 0:11:39.314
I got this money broker, Gonzalo Mora Jr.,

0:11:39.400 --> 0:11:41.096
- who can connect us with some...
- Okay, let me guess,

0:11:41.120 --> 0:11:42.776
you have a Colombian snitch
who gave you that name?

0:11:42.800 --> 0:11:46.190
- They prefer to be called informants...
- I know what they prefer to be called.

0:11:46.400 --> 0:11:47.594
How long have you known him?

0:11:47.680 --> 0:11:49.696
- Long enough. What is this, 20 Questions?
- Long enough.

0:11:49.720 --> 0:11:52.109
- And how much is you offer?
- 250K. What do you care?

0:11:52.280 --> 0:11:53.952
Is it coming out of your pocket?

0:11:54.200 --> 0:11:56.191
$250,000 for...

0:11:56.280 --> 0:11:58.714
Yeah, nobody said the war on drugs
was gonna be cheap, bro.

0:11:59.520 --> 0:12:04.389
These people who sell information,
they walk on the dirty side of the street.

0:12:04.480 --> 0:12:06.710
And then they cross over
to the side that's been swept.

0:12:07.920 --> 0:12:10.753
But their shoes always stay muddy.

0:12:12.480 --> 0:12:13.754
Is that Shakespeare?

0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:18.389
Yeah. Shakespeare.

0:12:18.680 --> 0:12:21.240
- All right. All right.
- You can see yourself out over the wall.

0:12:21.360 --> 0:12:22.873
Okay. All right, be like that.

0:12:28.680 --> 0:12:29.999
Hey, Abreu.

0:12:31.680 --> 0:12:33.352
You trust this guy?

0:12:34.720 --> 0:12:36.676
As much as I trust you.

0:12:48.680 --> 0:12:50.193
Come on, man.

0:12:51.120 --> 0:12:53.156
Come on, pick up. Pick up.

0:13:02.520 --> 0:13:03.635
Yeah.

0:13:09.920 --> 0:13:11.990
Mmm. Mmm.

0:13:12.760 --> 0:13:15.274
These fucking things are so fresh, man.

0:13:17.200 --> 0:13:18.872
Hey, I got a bigger connect.

0:13:19.200 --> 0:13:22.033
- These guys are the biggest of the big.
- Oh, yeah?

0:13:22.320 --> 0:13:23.799
You need to trust me on that.

0:13:23.880 --> 0:13:26.633
Trust you, man?
I pay you for information, not trust.

0:13:26.880 --> 0:13:31.317
That's what I give you, man.
That ticket to the Super Bowl, papa.

0:13:43.760 --> 0:13:45.320
Yeah, Steve, I've been thinking.

0:13:45.560 --> 0:13:47.915
I think that
we've been doing this backwards.

0:13:49.880 --> 0:13:53.316
We've been following the drugs
to get to the bad guys.

0:13:54.640 --> 0:13:59.555
What if we chase the money
to get to the bad guys?

0:13:59.640 --> 0:14:01.995
- The real power up at the top.
- Okay.

0:14:02.920 --> 0:14:05.673
Only thing is,
I cannot work with Emir Abreu.

0:14:05.760 --> 0:14:06.954
That dude is nuts.

0:14:07.040 --> 0:14:08.917
- Well, can I be honest?
- Yeah.

0:14:09.240 --> 0:14:12.277
You can't work without him.
He's your way in.

0:14:23.440 --> 0:14:25.816
Come on, watch out,
you're stepping on all the bodies, man.

0:14:25.840 --> 0:14:26.840
What?

0:14:27.200 --> 0:14:30.096
You're stepping and it's disrespectful.
Hey, hey, look at this. Falconi.

0:14:30.120 --> 0:14:32.759
Come on. It's the Italianist-sounding
name ever. Come on.

0:14:33.800 --> 0:14:37.509
Look at the dates. You do the math.
I'd be 77 years old.

0:14:37.800 --> 0:14:40.678
- That's about right. Leathery and craggly.
- Let's go. Come on.

0:14:41.000 --> 0:14:42.960
- Are you even looking?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm looking.

0:14:44.800 --> 0:14:46.119
Here we go.

0:14:48.080 --> 0:14:49.479
Bob Musella.

0:14:50.800 --> 0:14:51.800
Dates are perfect.

0:14:52.960 --> 0:14:54.473
Hey, what about this one?

0:14:54.640 --> 0:14:55.914
Dominguez.

0:14:56.040 --> 0:14:58.998
Emilio Dominguez.
Close enough to Emir, I suppose.

0:14:59.320 --> 0:15:01.788
- Yeah, it's kind of sexy.
- The dates work.

0:15:01.920 --> 0:15:02.989
- Sexy?
- Yeah.

0:15:03.160 --> 0:15:04.957
- Who the hell cares if it's sexy?
- I care.

0:15:05.040 --> 0:15:07.315
It's my name.
I wanted to have a sexy name.

0:15:14.720 --> 0:15:17.917
I have developed
what I like to call my masterpiece.

0:15:18.000 --> 0:15:22.471
There's a built-in noise reduction system
to eliminate all undesirable sound.

0:15:22.840 --> 0:15:26.879
Eagle wings up, record. Horizontal, off.

0:15:27.320 --> 0:15:29.436
He is a real entrepreneur.

0:15:29.560 --> 0:15:31.790
Aeronautics, finance.

0:15:31.880 --> 0:15:34.155
Even has his own line of wholesale jewelry.

0:15:34.280 --> 0:15:36.096
- There he is. Eric Wellman.
- Got his hand in everything.

0:15:36.120 --> 0:15:38.588
How are you?
Good to see you. Emir Abreu.

0:15:38.680 --> 0:15:39.816
- Hey, man.
- What's up, my man?

0:15:39.840 --> 0:15:41.637
I've set up phone lines on the switchboard.

0:15:41.720 --> 0:15:44.314
- So, how did you two meet again?
- The IRS.

0:15:44.440 --> 0:15:47.955
IRS. You two must have got all the
pussy. "This is an audit, drop the panties."

0:15:48.040 --> 0:15:49.176
Don't encourage him.

0:15:49.200 --> 0:15:52.176
You've got access to my secretaries,
free use of the conference room.

0:15:52.200 --> 0:15:54.555
- Anything else, you only have to ask.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

0:15:54.720 --> 0:15:57.712
Chacho, this is so much more like it. Nice.

0:15:57.880 --> 0:15:59.856
You should have seen the apartment
Customs gave us.

0:15:59.880 --> 0:16:02.519
Oh, my God. It was so filthy
even the rats ran from it, you know.

0:16:03.000 --> 0:16:04.200
Thank you, Eric.

0:16:19.880 --> 0:16:20.880
Mmm!

0:16:28.040 --> 0:16:29.109
Okay.

0:16:59.760 --> 0:17:01.034
Welcome, everyone.

0:17:01.120 --> 0:17:03.998
It's parents' night. This is second grade.

0:17:04.800 --> 0:17:08.588
My lesson plan is a cooperative process
that I build with the parents.

0:17:09.400 --> 0:17:11.356
And to have you here...

0:17:11.880 --> 0:17:13.074
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

0:17:17.920 --> 0:17:19.035
I have to get this.

0:17:19.120 --> 0:17:20.120
Um...

0:17:20.440 --> 0:17:22.976
- I apologize. I... Should I...
- No, it's okay. Um...

0:17:23.000 --> 0:17:25.070
- No, it's... It's okay.
- Okay, sorry.

0:17:25.360 --> 0:17:26.918
Very sorry to interrupt.

0:17:27.520 --> 0:17:29.431
- Oh, hi.
- I'm Andrea's father.

0:17:29.520 --> 0:17:31.875
I hope she's doing well in school.
She loves it.

0:17:31.960 --> 0:17:33.552
- Oh, great.
- But I do have to go.

0:17:33.800 --> 0:17:35.296
- Um, do you need money for a cab?
- No, it's okay.

0:17:35.320 --> 0:17:37.197
You're okay. Okay. Sorry.

0:17:38.320 --> 0:17:39.799
- Thanks. Bye.
- No problem.

0:18:41.960 --> 0:18:43.359
- Ah!
- Eh.

0:21:09.560 --> 0:21:10.560
Hey!

0:21:14.480 --> 0:21:16.038
Shut the fuck up!

0:21:21.920 --> 0:21:23.353
Eh...

0:21:56.280 --> 0:21:57.280
Hey.

0:21:57.720 --> 0:22:00.616
- What the hell happened back there?
- What were you so pissed off about, man?

0:22:00.640 --> 0:22:03.016
- What am I pissed off about?
- Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, man.

0:22:03.040 --> 0:22:05.096
I called your wife and told her
you were gonna be late for dinner

0:22:05.120 --> 0:22:06.456
'cause you were locked in a closet,
you know.

0:22:06.480 --> 0:22:08.600
Bob, we're all waiting
for you to come out the closet.

0:22:08.720 --> 0:22:09.976
You know that, right?

0:22:11.360 --> 0:22:13.590
So, this is all just a joke to you?

0:22:13.680 --> 0:22:15.336
Oh, come on, man. You need a beer.
You need to relax.

0:22:15.360 --> 0:22:17.078
I don't want a beer, I want answers.

0:22:17.520 --> 0:22:19.416
Bro, what do I have to do
to make you happy, man?

0:22:19.440 --> 0:22:20.953
Just don't get me killed.

0:22:21.160 --> 0:22:23.456
Oh, that's just... Hold it, hold it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

0:22:23.480 --> 0:22:26.278
I gotta write that shit down.
That's fucking brilliant.

0:22:26.720 --> 0:22:28.517
"Don't get Bob killed."

0:22:28.600 --> 0:22:29.919
Cut the shit, will you?

0:22:30.480 --> 0:22:33.056
It's the little things that get you whacked,
do you understand that?

0:22:33.080 --> 0:22:34.840
- I understand that.
- And that's why I plan.

0:22:34.920 --> 0:22:37.229
And so when your snitch pulls a gun on me,

0:22:37.320 --> 0:22:39.936
- a gun that he's not supposed to have...
- Okay, man, I didn't know. I'm...

0:22:39.960 --> 0:22:41.075
...I start to wonder,

0:22:41.160 --> 0:22:44.357
"Is Emir on my side? Is he with me or not?"

0:22:44.520 --> 0:22:46.496
Man, you never gotta question
if I'm on your side or not

0:22:46.520 --> 0:22:48.112
'cause I'm always on your fucking side!

0:22:48.200 --> 0:22:49.269
Do you have my back?

0:22:49.400 --> 0:22:52.039
I got your back, man.
Do you have my fucking back?

0:22:55.160 --> 0:22:56.229
Bob.

0:23:04.960 --> 0:23:06.313
Thank you.

0:23:08.040 --> 0:23:09.234
Bobby.

0:23:09.320 --> 0:23:11.072
- You look good, Dom.
- Thank you.

0:23:12.480 --> 0:23:14.152
Sorry about the cuffs. Regulations.

0:23:14.240 --> 0:23:16.595
What are you gonna do?
Don't worry about it.

0:23:18.800 --> 0:23:21.360
You should put those on.
Could get a little messy.

0:23:22.120 --> 0:23:23.155
You serious?

0:23:26.240 --> 0:23:27.309
Fucking hell.

0:23:31.400 --> 0:23:33.755
Get the fuck out of here. Bobby, come on.

0:23:35.160 --> 0:23:36.639
Fuck. What, no coffee?

0:23:38.000 --> 0:23:39.319
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck you, Bobby.

0:23:39.400 --> 0:23:41.176
You didn't forget?
What's the matter with you?

0:23:41.200 --> 0:23:42.349
Black coffee.

0:23:43.440 --> 0:23:45.237
- Two sugars.
- Thank you, Bob.

0:23:46.520 --> 0:23:47.589
Fuck.

0:23:48.960 --> 0:23:50.439
Look, Dom.

0:23:51.080 --> 0:23:54.993
I don't care who you work for right now.
I really don't. I'm not here for that.

0:23:55.760 --> 0:23:58.877
- Right, so what do you want, Bob?
- When you cooperated before,

0:24:00.760 --> 0:24:02.318
it led to drugs off the street,

0:24:02.400 --> 0:24:05.915
and a lot of punks right here
in this shithole that you call your home.

0:24:06.000 --> 0:24:08.355
- Sorry, Bobby, I can't rat.
- I'm not asking you to rat.

0:24:08.600 --> 0:24:09.828
Can't do it.

0:24:09.960 --> 0:24:13.589
I'm asking you to just act.

0:24:15.040 --> 0:24:17.713
- Like fucking what?
- Like you.

0:24:18.800 --> 0:24:21.553
Just be yourself. I need you.

0:24:29.720 --> 0:24:32.029
You been sleeping
in your office again, counselor?

0:24:32.160 --> 0:24:33.479
Why would I go home?

0:24:33.560 --> 0:24:35.841
So many wonderful criminals and perverts
to hang out with.

0:24:36.960 --> 0:24:38.632
- You all set out here?
- Yeah.

0:24:38.760 --> 0:24:40.557
Okay. Flip him or fuck him.

0:24:47.080 --> 0:24:48.399
All right.

0:24:54.560 --> 0:24:58.269
You have an impressive portfolio,
Mr. Musella.

0:24:58.600 --> 0:24:59.953
Musella. Thank you.

0:25:00.360 --> 0:25:05.354
I manage the financial affairs
of a group of Colombian businessmen.

0:25:06.400 --> 0:25:09.312
They've accumulated wealth
in foreign accounts

0:25:09.400 --> 0:25:12.437
and would like me to invest it for them
in Florida real estate.

0:25:13.720 --> 0:25:15.676
- Is that feasible?
- It's not a problem.

0:25:16.920 --> 0:25:18.856
You think you'll need to move money
the other way,

0:25:18.880 --> 0:25:20.438
from the US out of the country?

0:25:22.760 --> 0:25:25.274
That would be something
we might consider.

0:25:33.640 --> 0:25:35.756
- Hey. How are you?
- What's up, man?

0:25:41.800 --> 0:25:42.949
Mr. Dominguez?

0:25:44.120 --> 0:25:46.076
- I'm Lee Palmer.
- That ready?

0:25:47.360 --> 0:25:49.616
- I like the way you work, sir.
- Come on, let's get to it.

0:25:49.640 --> 0:25:50.640
- Follow me.
- All right.

0:27:11.760 --> 0:27:12.909
Okay.

0:27:13.200 --> 0:27:15.350
All right.
Now, I'm gonna feed the wire.

0:27:15.720 --> 0:27:17.392
Yeah. Yeah, I got it, Dad.

0:27:17.640 --> 0:27:18.834
Pull it.

0:27:19.400 --> 0:27:23.518
Now, you see that little tab of tape
on the end here?

0:27:23.600 --> 0:27:25.477
- Yeah. Okay.
- You can come on down.

0:27:27.720 --> 0:27:30.598
- There we go. Hey, look at that.
- Cool, Dad.

0:27:31.960 --> 0:27:33.279
What are you doing?

0:27:34.080 --> 0:27:36.469
What am I doing?
Well, Scotty and I are hooking up a light.

0:27:36.560 --> 0:27:41.156
So, when someone calls Daddy's work line,
it flashes instead of rings.

0:27:43.320 --> 0:27:44.520
Guys, go get ready for dinner.

0:27:44.720 --> 0:27:46.039
- Okay.
- Okay.

0:27:46.760 --> 0:27:48.432
- Wash your hands.
- Yeah, Mom.

0:27:50.920 --> 0:27:52.069
Hey.

0:27:58.120 --> 0:27:59.473
You okay?

0:28:01.960 --> 0:28:04.315
Promise me this is the last one.

0:28:08.080 --> 0:28:09.399
I promise.

0:28:10.800 --> 0:28:11.994
Good.

0:28:16.000 --> 0:28:17.149
Okay?

0:28:20.520 --> 0:28:22.192
So, what's your UC?

0:28:25.640 --> 0:28:28.632
- I launder money for the mob.
- Oh, that figures.

0:28:29.560 --> 0:28:32.074
- Why?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

0:28:33.240 --> 0:28:36.118
- What? You're looking at my hair.
- No, it, it...

0:29:07.760 --> 0:29:12.436
Gentlemen, I sincerely apologize.
Family business got in the way.

0:29:12.680 --> 0:29:15.638
Señor Mora, Gonzalo. Bob Musella.

0:29:15.720 --> 0:29:18.234
Pleasure to meet you.
Please, let me make it up to you.

0:29:19.960 --> 0:29:22.997
We are going to have a fantastic evening.

0:29:23.080 --> 0:29:24.960
- I promise you that.
- Yeah.

0:29:27.200 --> 0:29:28.599
Hey, Bobby, come here.

0:29:30.840 --> 0:29:33.354
- You look fucking great, man.
- Yeah?

0:29:41.840 --> 0:29:44.718
My financial structure is already in place.

0:29:45.400 --> 0:29:48.278
So, you invest with me
and a portion of your money stays put

0:29:48.880 --> 0:29:53.032
while the majority of your cash
gets filtered through my businesses

0:29:53.120 --> 0:29:55.873
so that you are able to do with it
what you please.

0:29:56.160 --> 0:29:59.709
We don't park cash.
That isn't the way we do business.

0:30:00.640 --> 0:30:05.111
Mr. Mora, with all due respect,
it's the way I do business.

0:30:05.720 --> 0:30:08.188
Now, I've checked your transactions.

0:30:08.560 --> 0:30:12.439
Large sums to companies like
Southern Air Transport,

0:30:12.840 --> 0:30:15.400
that raises the Feds' antennae. You know...

0:30:18.400 --> 0:30:21.631
Exactly. It looks like
one big money laundering machine.

0:30:21.720 --> 0:30:23.597
And that's not what you want.
That's not bueno.

0:30:23.720 --> 0:30:29.352
However, smaller sums with more
frequent deposits through my companies

0:30:29.920 --> 0:30:32.639
fly right under the radar of the Feds.
You know why?

0:30:33.240 --> 0:30:36.038
Because all of my companies are legitimate.

0:30:36.280 --> 0:30:37.599
Capisce?

0:30:37.760 --> 0:30:40.433
I cannot allow my businesses

0:30:40.880 --> 0:30:44.236
and your money to be compromised.

0:30:46.800 --> 0:30:48.836
What you say is reasonable.

0:30:50.280 --> 0:30:52.555
- We have to speak to our bosses.
- Of course.

0:30:52.640 --> 0:30:55.791
Yeah, nothing more can happen
without their okay.

0:30:56.520 --> 0:30:59.956
- I will set it up.
- Thank you. Thank you. That's all I ask.

0:31:00.480 --> 0:31:02.869
Okay, I promise. No more business.

0:31:02.960 --> 0:31:05.952
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go. Just fun from now on.

0:31:06.880 --> 0:31:09.110
And this is on me
because I'm ashamed I was late.

0:31:09.520 --> 0:31:12.114
And you know,
I got a surprise for you tonight.

0:31:18.200 --> 0:31:20.919
She's my present for you tonight, Mr. Bob.

0:31:46.000 --> 0:31:48.992
Your friend paid me for
anything you desire.

0:32:09.520 --> 0:32:11.158
You're beautiful.

0:32:12.240 --> 0:32:14.356
But I'm good. Okay?

0:32:28.560 --> 0:32:29.913
Mr. Bob?

0:32:33.200 --> 0:32:34.918
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

0:32:35.040 --> 0:32:36.040
Yeah, yeah.

0:32:36.240 --> 0:32:37.912
No, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.

0:32:41.160 --> 0:32:42.354
Yeah, well...

0:32:43.200 --> 0:32:48.115
You don't know me very well, my friend,
but I'm engaged

0:32:50.000 --> 0:32:52.036
to be married. You know, so...

0:32:53.920 --> 0:32:55.035
So?

0:32:56.960 --> 0:32:58.598
You know, I...

0:32:59.480 --> 0:33:01.914
I shit the bed on the first marriage.

0:33:02.040 --> 0:33:03.075
Does that... Comprende?

0:33:03.640 --> 0:33:04.640
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

0:33:04.720 --> 0:33:07.320
And I don't wanna fuck this one up.
You know what I mean? So, I...

0:33:09.040 --> 0:33:11.270
- Oh, yeah, go ahead, laugh. Go ahead.
- Okay.

0:33:11.360 --> 0:33:12.873
All right, all right.

0:33:20.680 --> 0:33:22.193
A fiancée, Bob?

0:33:22.320 --> 0:33:23.320
Huh?

0:33:23.400 --> 0:33:25.789
Are you kidding me? A fucking fi-an-cée.

0:33:26.520 --> 0:33:27.669
I'm a married man.

0:33:27.760 --> 0:33:29.193
Bob, you're undercover.

0:33:29.280 --> 0:33:31.236
You gotta do
whatever the fuck you gotta do, man.

0:33:31.360 --> 0:33:32.840
You should have fucked that stripper,

0:33:32.880 --> 0:33:35.553
fucking do a line of coke,
anything to stay alive, man.

0:33:35.640 --> 0:33:37.358
You got the best fucking job in the world.

0:33:37.440 --> 0:33:39.400
I can't believe
I have to talk you into this shit.

0:33:39.760 --> 0:33:41.796
Bob, I know these people, man.

0:33:41.880 --> 0:33:44.856
You gotta play with them, you gotta
drink with them, you gotta fuck with them.

0:33:44.880 --> 0:33:46.359
That's the way you get their trust.

0:33:46.440 --> 0:33:48.954
Hey, I'm alive, aren't I?

0:33:49.520 --> 0:33:51.875
Oh, my God, you're a piece of work, Bob.

0:33:51.960 --> 0:33:53.552
You're a fucking piece of work.

0:33:54.480 --> 0:33:57.040
I mean, why are you even doing this, Bob?
Why do you even bother?

0:33:57.120 --> 0:33:59.096
I mean, I heard about
the retirement they offered you.

0:33:59.120 --> 0:34:02.669
You, the wife, and kids, you guys could be
playing cricket on a yacht, eating early...

0:34:02.880 --> 0:34:05.394
Whatever it is that fucking white people do
when you retire.

0:34:05.800 --> 0:34:07.074
Why are you doing this?

0:34:08.200 --> 0:34:11.112
Man, because I love this shit.
That's why, baby.

0:34:11.400 --> 0:34:13.118
It's my fucking drug of choice.

0:34:13.800 --> 0:34:15.279
Let me tell you something, nobody,

0:34:16.040 --> 0:34:18.395
nobody does it better than me.

0:34:18.480 --> 0:34:20.471
So, listen to me sometimes, will you?

0:35:37.360 --> 0:35:39.874
My friends, welcome to the United States.

0:35:40.000 --> 0:35:43.231
- Mr. Bob.
- Gonzalo. Pleasure.

0:35:45.080 --> 0:35:48.709
This man here is Javier Ospina.
He does laundry for Escobar.

0:35:49.080 --> 0:35:51.071
Robert Musella. Pleasure to meet you, sir.

0:35:51.720 --> 0:35:53.039
The pleasure's mine.

0:35:54.720 --> 0:35:55.948
And you are?

0:35:57.240 --> 0:35:58.753
She's with me.

0:35:59.600 --> 0:36:02.114
- She's with him? She's with him.
- She's with him, yeah.

0:36:02.320 --> 0:36:04.520
How about that, huh?
Hey, I don't know if you know this,

0:36:04.560 --> 0:36:07.597
- but Bob owns all of Oceanbird Airlines.
- Boss. You need to sign these.

0:36:08.200 --> 0:36:09.553
Thank you.

0:36:11.200 --> 0:36:15.591
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Dominic. He's my
cousin and also an executive with Oceanbird.

0:36:15.760 --> 0:36:17.796
No, tell them the truth. I'm your asshole.

0:36:17.920 --> 0:36:20.216
Any time Bob's ass is in a hole,
mine better hop straight to it.

0:36:20.240 --> 0:36:22.117
I'd do anything for my cousin. All right?

0:36:22.760 --> 0:36:25.256
All right, who's ready to go to Jersey, right?

0:36:25.280 --> 0:36:26.429
Let's go to Bob's mansion.

0:36:28.320 --> 0:36:29.992
It's a nice little place, but, please...

0:36:39.240 --> 0:36:41.435
- Well, welcome to my home.
- Thank you.

0:36:41.800 --> 0:36:44.314
Because of the family's business,

0:36:44.560 --> 0:36:47.836
I have access to foreign banks,
including Panama,

0:36:47.920 --> 0:36:51.390
which has strict secrecy laws
that protects us all.

0:36:53.480 --> 0:36:56.438
Your business will boom
if you work with me.

0:36:56.840 --> 0:36:59.035
I'm sorry, Mr. Bob. But what is "boom"?

0:37:00.960 --> 0:37:02.234
Boom... Uh...

0:37:03.040 --> 0:37:04.080
Grow.

0:37:04.360 --> 0:37:06.316
You gotta understand that Bob's a gardener,

0:37:06.600 --> 0:37:10.718
and he sprinkles a little water on the money,
and all of a sudden it blooms.

0:37:11.480 --> 0:37:12.993
What is "bloom"?

0:37:13.160 --> 0:37:14.440
Bloom, it's...

0:37:14.760 --> 0:37:17.149
It's rooms and rooms full of cash, chacho.

0:37:17.360 --> 0:37:19.476
Rooms filled with cash.

0:37:19.560 --> 0:37:22.233
- Sí, something like that. Yeah. Yeah.
- Sounds good, man.

0:37:22.360 --> 0:37:25.318
- May God bless you with that problem.
- Yeah, amen to that.

0:37:27.240 --> 0:37:31.677
Well, my people in Colombia
have always been

0:37:31.760 --> 0:37:34.513
very, very comfortable
with the Panamanian banks.

0:37:34.600 --> 0:37:38.149
Noriega has handled
some of our most sensitive business.

0:37:38.520 --> 0:37:42.513
I promise you that I will make it
my business to enhance yours.

0:37:43.360 --> 0:37:48.480
And when I do, I need a promise from you
that you will make it your business

0:37:49.160 --> 0:37:50.878
to let the right people know my name.

0:37:52.120 --> 0:37:53.473
Money makes money.

0:37:54.040 --> 0:37:55.360
Here's to that.

0:37:56.440 --> 0:37:59.716
Now, no one can put me in jail
because I make a bad loan.

0:37:59.800 --> 0:38:02.155
However, if I'm dishing out cash

0:38:02.240 --> 0:38:05.516
to a client like Southern Air Transport,
which has no cover,

0:38:06.360 --> 0:38:09.318
and one of their planes goes down
with a load of powder,

0:38:10.360 --> 0:38:11.713
I am fucked.

0:38:12.640 --> 0:38:14.995
And so are you. And you, and you.

0:38:16.360 --> 0:38:21.388
So, I need a face-to-face with the man
who runs Southern Air Transport

0:38:22.040 --> 0:38:24.040
so I can clean up this mess.

0:38:31.000 --> 0:38:32.069
Mr. Bob,

0:38:32.880 --> 0:38:35.713
I think we should walk before we run.

0:38:37.600 --> 0:38:40.637
Everything will happen in the right time.

0:38:47.960 --> 0:38:49.075
Mr. Mora, are you okay?

0:38:50.760 --> 0:38:52.240
Dom, can you help us out here?

0:38:53.400 --> 0:38:54.656
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right.

0:38:54.680 --> 0:38:56.318
Help him out here a little bit.

0:38:56.400 --> 0:38:58.516
I told him not to drink.
He has sugar in his blood.

0:38:58.600 --> 0:39:00.536
- Get him a nice cold washcloth.
- Right. Right.

0:39:00.560 --> 0:39:02.360
- Help him out.
- Are you all right?

0:39:07.560 --> 0:39:09.576
- Oh, Mora Sr. All right?
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

0:39:09.600 --> 0:39:10.715
He'll be down in a minute.

0:39:14.520 --> 0:39:16.192
Get your hands off me!

0:39:38.160 --> 0:39:40.958
Gonzalo, I cannot live
with Ospina touching me.

0:39:41.920 --> 0:39:44.798
- Touching you?
- Yeah. He grabbed me.

0:39:48.080 --> 0:39:49.752
- You find that funny?
- He likes you.

0:39:50.760 --> 0:39:52.079
- That's...
- Wow. No, listen,

0:39:52.200 --> 0:39:54.998
actually Ospina's nickname
is La Mina, you know.

0:39:55.480 --> 0:39:59.075
It means two things in Spanish.
Gold mine or land mine.

0:39:59.200 --> 0:40:00.474
With him you never know.

0:40:01.000 --> 0:40:05.516
But, my friend, a condition of
doing business with us is doing Ospina.

0:40:10.640 --> 0:40:13.757
Are you saying that
you want me to fuck Ospina?

0:40:13.840 --> 0:40:16.035
- Or have Ospina fuck me?
- Yeah.

0:40:16.720 --> 0:40:19.439
- To make a deal? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

0:40:20.120 --> 0:40:22.680
- He's our family, you know...
- Fuck that! There's no deal.

0:40:23.560 --> 0:40:26.996
- Okay, no deal. Okay, okay. Let's go.
- I'm out. No deal. Sorry.

0:40:27.080 --> 0:40:28.920
- He'll take you anywhere you wanna go.
- Okay.

0:40:30.840 --> 0:40:32.068
Oh, shit.

0:40:32.280 --> 0:40:34.032
Got you, man.

0:40:34.160 --> 0:40:35.878
You son of a bitch.

0:40:36.040 --> 0:40:37.996
- You son of a bitch.
- He's fucking with you.

0:40:39.040 --> 0:40:40.856
- He came on to me...
- Did you know about this?

0:40:40.880 --> 0:40:43.030
He came on to me, too. Fucking maricón.

0:40:43.520 --> 0:40:44.794
But the cartel loves him.

0:40:45.520 --> 0:40:47.351
He is the favorite son, Mr. Bob.

0:40:47.600 --> 0:40:51.513
So, even if you see him fucking a goat,
which you might,

0:40:52.360 --> 0:40:56.478
you must say,
"That's a fucking nice-looking goat, man."

0:41:15.480 --> 0:41:17.152
I will keep my hands off you,

0:41:18.160 --> 0:41:21.914
if you keep your eyes on my bosses' money.

0:41:23.240 --> 0:41:26.869
The Moras have staked
more than their reputation,

0:41:26.960 --> 0:41:28.359
they have staked their lives.

0:41:30.600 --> 0:41:32.591
And yours, I'm afraid.

0:41:50.040 --> 0:41:52.429
Let me remind you of something, Bobby,
all right.

0:41:52.960 --> 0:41:55.269
You're a fucking poser, and so are you.

0:41:55.360 --> 0:41:57.555
And that faggot out there...

0:41:57.680 --> 0:41:59.671
You fuck this up, he'll kill you,

0:41:59.760 --> 0:42:01.536
he'll kill your fucking wife,
and your two kids.

0:42:01.560 --> 0:42:03.976
And do the same to this asshole here,
and then he's gonna kill me.

0:42:04.000 --> 0:42:05.000
You understand?

0:42:06.280 --> 0:42:07.952
- You understand?
- Yeah.

0:42:09.920 --> 0:42:11.353
Jesus Christ.

0:42:14.440 --> 0:42:16.136
I will keep my hands off you,

0:42:16.160 --> 0:42:19.948
if you keep your eyes on my bosses' money.

0:42:20.520 --> 0:42:23.353
The Moras have staked
more than their reputation,

0:42:23.440 --> 0:42:25.476
they have staked their lives.

0:42:25.560 --> 0:42:27.437
And yours, I'm afraid.

0:42:29.480 --> 0:42:34.793
Idea of the month goes to Mazur.
Operation C-Chase. Capital "C" for cash.

0:42:35.120 --> 0:42:38.954
Washington wants to make C-Chase
the biggest bust in US Customs history.

0:42:40.240 --> 0:42:42.071
These guys need no introduction.

0:42:42.280 --> 0:42:45.192
Pablo Escobar
and his little bitch, Don Chepe.

0:42:46.520 --> 0:42:49.080
His top finance guy, Rudy Armbrecht.

0:42:49.680 --> 0:42:54.196
And his main distributor, Roberto Alcaino.
AKA the jeweler.

0:42:54.520 --> 0:42:55.635
Let's stop this poison.

0:42:55.800 --> 0:42:57.597
All right. Out, out, out. Everybody out.

0:42:57.760 --> 0:42:58.829
Oh, oh, wait.

0:42:59.280 --> 0:43:02.590
You're all on administratively
uncontrollable overtime, so I own you.

0:43:02.720 --> 0:43:03.720
Out.

0:43:05.880 --> 0:43:07.871
Mazur, not so fast.

0:43:11.040 --> 0:43:12.040
What?

0:43:12.120 --> 0:43:13.856
You stuck your foot in your mouth
with the Moras.

0:43:13.880 --> 0:43:14.915
Ertz, get in here.

0:43:16.000 --> 0:43:18.958
So, meet your soon-to-be wife.
Kathy Ertz, Bob Mazur.

0:43:19.040 --> 0:43:20.712
I wish you many happy years.

0:43:21.040 --> 0:43:22.519
- Hi.
- Hello.

0:43:22.680 --> 0:43:24.193
Nice to meet you.

0:43:24.840 --> 0:43:27.229
Um, Tischler asked me
to give you my profile.

0:43:28.640 --> 0:43:31.359
- One page?
- I'm not too complicated.

0:43:36.320 --> 0:43:39.357
Damn, I need a fiancée. Oh, shit.

0:43:43.200 --> 0:43:44.633
Hey, Bonni.

0:43:45.560 --> 0:43:47.630
Bonni, wait up.

0:43:47.720 --> 0:43:50.837
Look, I know I invented a fiancée,
but I work better alone.

0:43:50.920 --> 0:43:53.720
You think I have women lining up
around the block wanting to marry you?

0:43:56.040 --> 0:43:58.508
- How many undercovers has she done?
- She's a virgin.

0:43:58.600 --> 0:43:59.919
Oh, my God.

0:44:00.560 --> 0:44:02.198
Look, she's just window dressing.

0:44:02.720 --> 0:44:06.190
So is this. Compliments of
your government's impound authority.

0:44:06.680 --> 0:44:08.830
- Mercedes?
- It's who you know, Mazur.

0:44:09.600 --> 0:44:11.318
Now go out
and get to know whoever it takes

0:44:11.400 --> 0:44:13.200
to make me look like I
rubbed the right dick.

0:44:14.320 --> 0:44:15.673
It's a metaphor.

0:44:21.280 --> 0:44:22.349
Yes?

0:44:22.600 --> 0:44:26.070
Mr. Musella,
it's Akbar Bilgrami

0:44:26.440 --> 0:44:29.910
at the Panama branch
from BCCI Bank on line three.

0:44:30.360 --> 0:44:31.793
Okay, thank you.

0:44:36.560 --> 0:44:38.710
- This is Robert Musella.
- Mr. Musella.

0:44:39.160 --> 0:44:41.993
Akbar Bilgrami, BCCI, Panama, here.

0:44:42.080 --> 0:44:44.230
I see your accounts are quite active.

0:44:45.920 --> 0:44:49.356
- Is that a problem?
- No, no, quite the opposite.

0:44:49.520 --> 0:44:52.193
But we do have a problem
with two of your checks.

0:44:52.280 --> 0:44:53.952
Now, on one,

0:44:54.040 --> 0:44:56.235
the payee is blank.

0:44:56.320 --> 0:44:59.232
And on the other the amounts are different.

0:44:59.320 --> 0:45:00.389
I'm so sorry.

0:45:00.480 --> 0:45:01.959
I'm not at my desk at the moment,

0:45:02.120 --> 0:45:03.599
so I... I can't...

0:45:03.760 --> 0:45:07.673
Sir, in the future
I will manage this personally.

0:45:08.240 --> 0:45:11.596
We do this for our customers
who handle special clients.

0:45:12.120 --> 0:45:13.394
Do you understand?

0:45:14.120 --> 0:45:15.599
Yes, I think I do.

0:45:15.800 --> 0:45:18.951
At BCCI, we're a full-service bank.

0:45:19.960 --> 0:45:23.589
Mr. Bilgrami, as long as I have you
on the phone, I wonder if you can help me.

0:45:23.920 --> 0:45:28.038
Is there anyone on your team
who can help me here, in the States?

0:45:29.320 --> 0:45:33.950
I'm afraid that if not, I might have
to keep the money flow to a minimum.

0:45:35.720 --> 0:45:41.078
Well, I'm sure our Miami execs could
assist you. Would you like to meet them?

0:45:43.120 --> 0:45:46.795
Yes. Yes, I think that
might be very helpful.

0:45:47.880 --> 0:45:49.359
Mr. Palmer will arrange it.

0:45:50.680 --> 0:45:54.036
Well, thank you very much.
You've been most kind. Goodbye.

0:46:00.440 --> 0:46:03.591
In the future
I will manage this personally.

0:46:03.920 --> 0:46:07.390
We do this for our customers
who handle special clients.

0:46:07.480 --> 0:46:08.799
Do you understand?

0:46:18.360 --> 0:46:20.096
It's so nice to have you in Miami,
Mr. Musella.

0:46:20.120 --> 0:46:21.120
Thanks.

0:46:21.200 --> 0:46:23.031
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

0:46:24.200 --> 0:46:27.476
This is Mr. Awan,
President of our North American division.

0:46:27.560 --> 0:46:28.879
Hi, Bob Musella.

0:46:28.960 --> 0:46:31.679
And Mr. Bilgrami,
who you've spoken with on the phone.

0:46:31.840 --> 0:46:33.558
Head of our Latin American division.

0:46:34.000 --> 0:46:36.753
We are a very important institution,
Mr. Musella,

0:46:37.200 --> 0:46:38.872
in America and worldwide.

0:46:39.560 --> 0:46:41.471
We are owned
by Middle Eastern businessmen

0:46:41.560 --> 0:46:43.551
with very strong ties to your government.

0:46:43.880 --> 0:46:45.359
Your money is safe with us.

0:46:46.040 --> 0:46:47.553
That's what I wanna hear

0:46:48.360 --> 0:46:51.477
because my clients are businessmen, too,
like yourselves,

0:46:52.360 --> 0:46:54.316
only their business is selling cocaine.

0:47:00.760 --> 0:47:02.512
Could you excuse us for a moment, please?

0:47:03.120 --> 0:47:04.189
Of course.

0:48:02.560 --> 0:48:06.519
Mr. Ian Howard
is one of our BCCI European executive.

0:48:07.280 --> 0:48:09.669
Mr. Bilgrami and Mr. Awan
have taken good care of you?

0:48:10.800 --> 0:48:12.916
Yes, yes. Excellent.

0:48:13.080 --> 0:48:16.197
Good. Because BCCI is a reputable bank.

0:48:19.120 --> 0:48:21.156
Look, I assure you...

0:48:21.240 --> 0:48:23.515
No, no. No assurances from you.
Only from us.

0:48:25.120 --> 0:48:26.553
Please, take a seat.

0:48:33.400 --> 0:48:37.393
We buy gold or diamonds,
keep them in our secure vaults

0:48:37.600 --> 0:48:40.672
or we could send your money to Paris
or our headquarters in London,

0:48:41.000 --> 0:48:42.797
other banks around the globe,

0:48:42.920 --> 0:48:45.150
deposit it, wire transfer to Panama.

0:48:46.000 --> 0:48:50.152
We like to be nimble with our clients' cash.
How does that sound?

0:48:52.320 --> 0:48:54.231
Sounds like I came to the right bank.

0:50:00.480 --> 0:50:04.393
Illegal cocaine is coming into our country
at alarming levels...

0:50:04.840 --> 0:50:06.600
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

0:50:07.480 --> 0:50:09.232
- I'm being followed.
- What?

0:50:09.440 --> 0:50:11.908
- You got the plate?
- Yeah, I did.

0:50:12.040 --> 0:50:13.837
Here, here. I'll handle it.

0:50:16.000 --> 0:50:18.798
- You all right?
- Fine.

0:50:20.400 --> 0:50:22.231
I'm fine. Let's do this.

0:50:22.320 --> 0:50:24.176
Okay, here we go.
Let's play this newlywed game.

0:50:24.200 --> 0:50:27.192
All right, Kathy, what do you know
about your handsome fiancé Bob?

0:50:27.280 --> 0:50:28.280
Favorite drink?

0:50:28.480 --> 0:50:31.870
- He's a whiskey kind of guy.
- And she's a Manhattan girl.

0:50:32.280 --> 0:50:34.748
All right, that was too damn easy.
All right. Food she hates?

0:50:35.480 --> 0:50:38.438
- Uh... Yogurt.
- No. I love yogurt.

0:50:38.520 --> 0:50:41.034
- I thought you said you hated yogurt?
- I hate sour cream.

0:50:41.120 --> 0:50:43.200
- And mayonnaise.
- Sour cream and mayonnaise. Noted.

0:50:43.280 --> 0:50:45.635
Perfect. You already sound like
a married couple.

0:50:45.760 --> 0:50:48.479
- All right, favorite sport?
- Uh, she loves tennis.

0:50:48.560 --> 0:50:49.959
Football. The Bucs.

0:50:50.080 --> 0:50:52.514
Season tickets on the 20-yard line.

0:50:52.720 --> 0:50:54.790
Damn, woman, you're good.
Look at that memory.

0:50:54.960 --> 0:50:56.313
All right, how'd you meet?

0:50:56.640 --> 0:50:57.675
We were friends.

0:50:57.760 --> 0:50:59.830
I was trying to fix him up
with a friend of mine,

0:50:59.920 --> 0:51:01.319
he was trying to do the same.

0:51:01.400 --> 0:51:05.518
And then love struck and we were thinking,
"What are we doing?"

0:51:05.840 --> 0:51:07.273
And we cut out the middleman.

0:51:07.600 --> 0:51:09.556
Wait, that's how you met
your wife, isn't it?

0:51:09.640 --> 0:51:12.473
It is. Stay close to the truth,
makes it easier to lie.

0:51:13.200 --> 0:51:15.509
- Strangest sexual position?
- Hmm. What?

0:51:15.600 --> 0:51:17.456
All right, I'll let you slide on that.
I'll let...

0:51:17.480 --> 0:51:19.440
Yeah, right, Bob,
how many times you been in love?

0:51:20.120 --> 0:51:21.553
Just once.

0:51:24.000 --> 0:51:25.096
You never let me play with it.

0:51:25.120 --> 0:51:26.120
You always say that.

0:51:26.160 --> 0:51:27.776
- I'm always playing.
- But whenever I wanna play...

0:51:27.800 --> 0:51:28.994
Hey.

0:51:30.040 --> 0:51:31.678
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

0:51:36.360 --> 0:51:38.078
Hey.

0:51:38.160 --> 0:51:39.479
You look great.

0:51:45.360 --> 0:51:47.256
- Are you finished, ma'am?
- Yes, thank you.

0:51:48.440 --> 0:51:50.590
- How did you like your swordfish?
- It was good.

0:51:50.680 --> 0:51:51.680
Yeah?

0:51:53.040 --> 0:51:54.268
Thank you.

0:51:54.640 --> 0:51:57.438
Can you believe this,
put us way in the back here?

0:51:57.520 --> 0:52:00.616
I don't... They can't put us further back.
We're, like, in Alaska or something.

0:52:00.640 --> 0:52:03.279
Bob, we didn't have a reservation.
It's fine.

0:52:03.360 --> 0:52:04.429
It's not fine.

0:52:04.520 --> 0:52:07.273
There were three or four tables
that were empty on our way back here.

0:52:07.360 --> 0:52:08.360
Did you notice that?

0:52:08.560 --> 0:52:11.791
- It's fine. Really.
- It matters. It's a special occasion.

0:52:11.880 --> 0:52:13.916
- I know.
- And I want it to be special, okay.

0:52:16.560 --> 0:52:20.712
I'm just wondering
where my little Bobby the accountant went?

0:52:20.800 --> 0:52:23.268
- Nowhere, I'm right here.
- Kinda liked him.

0:52:23.520 --> 0:52:26.796
Hey. Kinda like you.
You look beautiful tonight, by the way.

0:52:27.880 --> 0:52:30.519
I have never seen you with a pocket scarf.

0:52:30.760 --> 0:52:32.398
- You like that?
- No, I hate it.

0:52:32.480 --> 0:52:34.869
- You hate it? It's a special occasion.
- Yeah.

0:52:34.960 --> 0:52:36.880
You're starting to look like them.

0:52:39.480 --> 0:52:43.234
Mr. Bob, you are practically
in the fucking toilets.

0:52:44.000 --> 0:52:45.856
- Tell them who you are.
- Tell me about it.

0:52:45.880 --> 0:52:47.916
I give the guy a 20,
I still end up back here.

0:52:48.240 --> 0:52:51.596
- Gonzalo, I'd like to introduce you to...
- She's your beautiful fiancée.

0:52:52.280 --> 0:52:55.477
Well, no, actually,
this is my secretary, Evelyn.

0:52:56.120 --> 0:52:58.315
This is Gonzalo Mora Sr.

0:52:58.920 --> 0:53:01.832
She is the best secretary
I have ever had in my life.

0:53:01.920 --> 0:53:04.275
She types faster than you fart, my friend.

0:53:04.640 --> 0:53:06.437
Listen, why don't you join us? Join us.

0:53:06.520 --> 0:53:09.592
Hey, pal.
Your best bottle of champagne, please.

0:53:09.680 --> 0:53:14.117
Here we go. Have a seat.
We are celebrating tonight.

0:53:14.280 --> 0:53:16.396
It is Evelyn's birthday.

0:53:16.480 --> 0:53:18.630
Speak of the devil, here it is.
Look at that.

0:53:18.720 --> 0:53:20.438
Look at the size of that fucking cake.

0:53:20.800 --> 0:53:22.358
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on.

0:53:22.760 --> 0:53:25.433
- This says "Happy Anniversary."
- Yes, sir.

0:53:25.520 --> 0:53:28.796
- I ordered a birthday cake.
- No, sir, you said it was an anniversary.

0:53:28.920 --> 0:53:30.239
Whoa. Excuse me. What?

0:53:30.320 --> 0:53:32.200
Why would I say it's my...
I'm not even married.

0:53:32.280 --> 0:53:34.936
- Why would I order an anniversary cake?
- I thought it was an anniversary...

0:53:34.960 --> 0:53:37.474
Now you're fucking this up.
What are you, a moron or something?

0:53:37.600 --> 0:53:39.955
- Bob, It's okay.
- It's not okay.

0:53:40.440 --> 0:53:42.158
We pay top dollar coming in here

0:53:42.480 --> 0:53:44.630
for good food and good service
and we got neither.

0:53:44.960 --> 0:53:49.158
Except I get this motherfucker
telling me that I'm a liar?

0:53:49.960 --> 0:53:52.576
- You calling me a liar again?
- No, sir, I'm not calling you a liar.

0:53:52.600 --> 0:53:53.696
- You're not calling me a liar?
- No.

0:53:53.720 --> 0:53:56.951
But you said that I told you
that I wanted an anniversary cake.

0:53:57.040 --> 0:53:58.040
Sir, I'm sorry.

0:53:58.200 --> 0:54:00.077
We have to understand something,
you and me.

0:54:00.160 --> 0:54:01.616
- You can read? All right.
- I can read, sir.

0:54:01.640 --> 0:54:06.077
When I look at this cake
it says to me, "Happy Anniversary."

0:54:06.160 --> 0:54:07.229
What does it say to you?

0:54:08.880 --> 0:54:11.320
It says, "Happy Anniversary!"
"Happy Anniversary," doesn't it?

0:54:12.040 --> 0:54:13.996
- Stop!
- Get that fucking thing away from me!

0:54:14.680 --> 0:54:16.193
Jesus.

0:54:16.280 --> 0:54:17.793
What the hell's wrong with you?

0:54:34.400 --> 0:54:36.152
I'm sorry, Ev.

0:54:42.800 --> 0:54:46.873
That was the most degrading, vicious,

0:54:46.960 --> 0:54:49.554
disgusting thing I have ever seen you do.

0:54:49.680 --> 0:54:51.750
I know. I'm sorry.

0:54:55.040 --> 0:54:56.951
I never wanted you to see that.

0:55:09.040 --> 0:55:10.234
So, what's she like?

0:55:12.240 --> 0:55:13.468
Who?

0:55:15.880 --> 0:55:17.438
"Who?"

0:55:21.280 --> 0:55:22.918
I hardly know her.

0:55:54.040 --> 0:55:57.316
Bob, I checked out
that license plate you gave me.

0:55:57.440 --> 0:55:59.635
Luckily your stalker
and I got the same taste.

0:55:59.760 --> 0:56:00.936
Wait a minute? You found him?

0:56:00.960 --> 0:56:03.793
Listen, Emir, follow protocol, please.
No antics.

0:56:03.920 --> 0:56:05.399
Just relax, all right.

0:56:05.600 --> 0:56:07.616
I got close enough to know that
he didn't smell like a perp.

0:56:07.640 --> 0:56:09.160
He had that familiar government scent.

0:56:11.880 --> 0:56:13.916
- So, where are you from?
- Kansas.

0:56:40.560 --> 0:56:42.320
Who the fuck
are you working for? Huh?

0:56:42.560 --> 0:56:44.118
Who do you work for, motherfucker?

0:56:47.480 --> 0:56:48.595
Shit.

0:56:50.600 --> 0:56:51.600
Oh, shit.

0:57:00.040 --> 0:57:02.998
Hey, that license number
you gave Emir, I searched it.

0:57:03.520 --> 0:57:05.656
Took me a while
'cause the car's registered to a company

0:57:05.680 --> 0:57:07.033
with an address on a vacant lot.

0:57:07.800 --> 0:57:11.839
The property records tie back to
what I've confirmed as a CIA front.

0:57:12.760 --> 0:57:15.433
- Emir was right. Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

0:57:16.200 --> 0:57:17.679
Here, take the tapes.

0:57:18.800 --> 0:57:22.315
Ospina authorized pickups
in Detroit, LA, Houston and New York.

0:57:22.560 --> 0:57:24.198
- He bought in?
- Yeah, he bought in.

0:57:25.120 --> 0:57:26.473
In a big way.

0:57:29.240 --> 0:57:30.719
You okay, Bob?

0:57:31.960 --> 0:57:34.713
- You don't seem yourself.
- You wanna talk to the psychologist?

0:57:35.760 --> 0:57:37.760
- No, I'm fine.
- Just wanna make sure you're okay.

0:57:38.280 --> 0:57:40.475
- What, I'm fine.
- Okay.

0:57:45.320 --> 0:57:47.016
Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on, number two.

0:57:47.040 --> 0:57:48.871
Come on, number two.
Come on, number two.

0:57:49.000 --> 0:57:51.389
Come on, baby. Come on.

0:57:51.720 --> 0:57:55.076
Come on, come on, run God damn it.
Run, run, run.

0:57:55.200 --> 0:57:58.237
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on, come on.

0:57:58.400 --> 0:57:59.753
Come on, come on, come on.

0:58:00.680 --> 0:58:03.399
Yes, yes, yes. Come on, baby.

0:58:05.160 --> 0:58:06.160
Ah, shit.

0:58:09.680 --> 0:58:12.592
Never trust an animal
without a jockey on its back.

0:58:12.680 --> 0:58:14.796
Who is there to fix the goddamn race?

0:58:16.120 --> 0:58:18.031
I've got a tip in the fifth.

0:58:18.120 --> 0:58:20.111
You got a tip, huh? Who from, the mutt?

0:58:21.280 --> 0:58:22.429
No.

0:58:24.000 --> 0:58:25.353
Ospina.

0:58:27.840 --> 0:58:30.434
It's a nice-looking ring.
What's that, a coca leaf?

0:58:32.080 --> 0:58:35.675
You know, most of the assholes I meet
think it's a maple leaf.

0:58:39.720 --> 0:58:42.951
My paperwork for Southern Air Transport
has to be in place.

0:58:43.080 --> 0:58:46.709
In order to do that we need to make it
look like I manage your money.

0:58:46.800 --> 0:58:49.473
Listen, friend, I never
fuck on the first date.

0:58:50.880 --> 0:58:52.438
Evening, ladies.

0:58:53.600 --> 0:58:57.309
Walmart on every block.
Smack dab in milk and honey land.

0:58:58.840 --> 0:59:00.751
America the beautiful.

0:59:00.840 --> 0:59:04.276
Only we don't get to the see the filth
on the other side of the store.

0:59:05.080 --> 0:59:06.877
The sewage of civilization.

0:59:07.000 --> 0:59:10.709
Hell, man, if it wasn't for the churches,
this whole fucking place would just die.

0:59:10.840 --> 0:59:14.879
You know, the Good Book?
It says, "Don't steal, don't lie."

0:59:14.960 --> 0:59:16.632
Well, who's that written for?

0:59:16.800 --> 0:59:21.271
You know, we pray for a good clean life,
a list of do's or don'ts,

0:59:21.360 --> 0:59:23.590
and we act like animals. All of us.

0:59:23.720 --> 0:59:28.236
And Nancy Reagan with her holier-than-thou
"just say no to drugs" bullshit.

0:59:28.320 --> 0:59:30.390
Ronny, you know,
he should've stayed the Gipper.

0:59:30.480 --> 0:59:32.120
He's nothing but a two-faced drug pusher.

0:59:33.000 --> 0:59:35.673
Whatever happened to good old integrity?

0:59:36.920 --> 0:59:41.072
Do you think that half homo Ospina
knows what's coming? Good luck.

0:59:41.680 --> 0:59:45.309
You, me and every other prick
is sucking on the tit of that golden calf.

1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:46.776
Now listen to me.
If one of those bullets was meant for you,

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:48.456
I wouldn't be talking to you now, would I?

1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:49.674
Look, Dominic, I...

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.512
- Who sent you, Ospina?
- No.

1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:54.561
- Was it that fucking Mora kid?
- No, no, I went on my own.

1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:57.951
Jesus, Bob, you sprung me
out of jail to watch your back,

1:00:58.040 --> 1:00:59.917
and now look at you, you're waist-deep.

1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:04.077
- You having fun without me?
- No.

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:07.336
Now, listen to me,
they're fucking meeting tonight.

1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:10.670
- It never happened, do you hear me?
- Okay, it never happened.

1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:12.000
Bobby, say it like you mean it.

1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:17.995
I mean, that it never happened.

1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:42.593
Do you think
that I'm doing a good job for you?

1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:44.349
Excellent.

1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:48.989
Then why don't you do right for me?

1:01:50.280 --> 1:01:53.989
You know that I'm only protected
if more people buy in.

1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:59.634
You promised to extend our network
if I delivered. And I have.

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:01.434
Boss...

1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:07.710
If you can't convince your bosses
to meet with me,

1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:11.955
then our arrangement is over.

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:16.669
Mr. Bob, the drug business
is a waiting game.

1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:18.154
I know.

1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:21.991
I've been trying
to teach this man some patience.

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.628
Your fiancée is a very wise woman.

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:28.150
And if I may be so bold,
incredibly ravishing.

1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:34.149
So, I think I will grant you the meeting.

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.719
We have reached
a point of no return, Mr. Bob.

1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:41.871
Have a great evening.

1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:18.671
Mr. Musella, it's time.

1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:34.519
Go forward.

1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:46.909
So, you are Robert Musella?

1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:50.189
I am.

1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:53.159
And you are?

1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:55.359
This way.

1:03:57.800 --> 1:03:59.279
Go to padrino.

1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:43.760
- What is your name?
- Joshua Baron.

1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:32.839
What is your name, sir?

1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:37.833
Your name?

1:05:38.680 --> 1:05:40.193
Robert Musella.

1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:10.118
Eshu Eleguá is protecting you today.
You're good.

1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:11.835
You are free to go.

1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:14.275
Get up. You can leave. Get up.

1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:16.194
Now.

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:32.958
It was an audition. You got the part.

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:57.071
Be ready in five minutes.

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:29.759
I was...

1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:39.314
So, Mr. Musella, what can you do for me?

1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:43.136
So, how do you feel
about the stock market?

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:45.355
No, no, too risky.

1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:47.032
It's like going to Vegas.

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:49.998
We like to take, not to be taken.

1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:54.278
Well, if you place funds
that are earmarked for investments

1:07:54.360 --> 1:07:57.636
into one of my firms here in New York,

1:07:57.760 --> 1:07:59.751
we can split the fees evenly.

1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:03.879
Or, you can simply put your money
into one of my mortgage accounts...

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:05.109
Oh, hey, hey.

1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:10.112
See, that way, it'll look like a loan
and then you just use the loan proceeds.

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:12.589
Now, there's a number of ways
that we can make this work.

1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:13.874
Wait till you meet her.

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:15.439
Hello, sweetheart.

1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:19.436
Watch this, Bobby, and learn.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:23.431
- Roberto Alcaino, this is my Aunt Vicky.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:26.717
- Mr. Alcaino...
- Call me Roberto, please.

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:30.110
Well, I love being
on a first-name basis with a gentleman.

1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:31.955
Come on.

1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:35.589
I love this park. It's my playground.

1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:37.716
See those buildings over there?

1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:38.875
They're mine.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.558
The one on the right's a piece of shit,
but I can't flip it.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:45.638
And the other one, Bobby and I just sold.
For how much, Bobby?

1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:47.790
Oh, my God.
We made a lot of money on that one.

1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:51.156
Actually a shitload of zeros
starting with the number 8.

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:52.639
But I hate to brag.

1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:57.479
Oh, my nephew here
is in charge of the finances.

1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:59.391
Yeah.
Bob has a real nose for business.

1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:00.708
And women.

1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:03.837
Well, thank you. I've always
had a thing for Latinos.

1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:06.630
So, you want an apartment?

1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:08.312
Ooh! Here comes the close.

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:09.833
Well, I do have a place upstate,

1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:12.639
but my wife is thinking
about an apartment in New York.

1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:15.439
If you're interested,
I can set that up for you, no problem.

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:19.153
Okay, Kathy,
time to go, spend some money.

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:20.240
- Hmm?
- Yes.

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:25.398
It was so lovely to meet you
and I cannot wait to meet your wife.

1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:28.313
I mean it.
I wanna have dinner, the sooner the better.

1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:30.231
- I would like that.
- All right.

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:33.835
Listen, escort these
lovely ladies to the car, please.

1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:35.638
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:37.153
- Have a good time.
- All right.

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:38.434
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:40.556
- Bye.
- Are we gonna go to Neiman's?

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:45.669
Your aunt reminds me of my tía Inez,
a wild horse,

1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:49.240
- a breath of fresh air in a cruel world.
- Hmm.

1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:53.274
And I thought she was one of a kind.

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:57.478
You know, I'm thinking about
financing and promoting a boxing match.

1:09:57.640 --> 1:09:58.640
Ooh!

1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:00.560
That's very risky business.

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:02.790
Or maybe
a shipping company in Buenos Aires.

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:05.440
Or a beach house.

1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:07.750
Now that I can help you make happen.

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:11.198
Are you and Kathy free tonight?

1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:14.749
Yeah, as far as I know,
we're free as birds.

1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:22.593
Cheers.

1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:25.439
Can I ask you a question?

1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:28.910
Have you ever had your palm read?

1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:38.350
Well, my wife Gloria believes in it,
but, sad to say, I am more of a skeptic.

1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:42.991
Well, my father was a diplomat,
so we traveled a lot,

1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:45.799
and this one time in India,

1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:50.158
a yogi came to visit us
and he taught me how to read the future.

1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:51.680
Oh...

1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:53.480
May I?

1:10:56.840 --> 1:10:57.840
Please.

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:03.397
Mmm... Oh, wow.

1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:05.874
Interesting.

1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:14.719
Is there a problem?

1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:21.071
No, I've just never seen quite
so many stars align at the fate line.

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:27.633
- Okay.
- It's more than okay.

1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.710
It means destiny
has marked you for success.

1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:36.189
Well, I like that.

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:41.031
- It's so beautiful.
- It is.

1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:44.317
It is Roberto's favorite painting
in our New York home.

1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:45.833
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:47.956
Kathy was an art major in college.

1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:53.557
I remember Sotheby's was
selling this to a private collector.

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:56.358
Is there anything I can do?

1:11:56.800 --> 1:11:59.633
My husband loves to be in charge,
even in the kitchen.

1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:01.438
Really? You hear that?

1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:05.039
I'm sleeping at Amy's.

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:06.269
See you later.

1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:10.354
Not until you say hi, we have company.

1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:13.000
Kathy, Bob, this is our daughter Bianca.

1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:14.456
- Hi, Bianca, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:15.480
Hi.

1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:39.111
- But of course.
- How many languages does she speak?

1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:42.909
- Four.
- Four.

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.958
Well, if you
count Pig Latin as a language, but...

1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:51.280
Kathy, I wanna show you something.

1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:56.398
Your fiancée is remarkable.

1:12:56.480 --> 1:12:57.708
Yeah, she is.

1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:02.674
I got to tell you, I would have been a chef,
but America put me in this business.

1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:04.656
It's their fault I'm not wearing an apron,

1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:06.910
sweating my balls off
in some kitchen somewhere.

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:10.478
But no demand, no supply.

1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:13.474
And there are a lot of folks with noses.

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:16.836
God gave us free will,
so who am I to stand in the way

1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:20.595
of someone who wants to indulge
in self-destructive behavior.

1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:23.837
- Salud.
- Oh, thank you.

1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:27.077
The politicians think it's a drug war,

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:30.869
shoot them up, Dirty Harry,
but I say it's a business like any other.

1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:33.838
Profits up, people come,
profits down, they leave,

1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:35.473
by any means necessary.

1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:40.435
The only difference is, in my business,

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:45.035
nothing good ever comes
in the absence of trust.

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:49.351
Without it there is no loyalty.

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.834
And when there is no loyalty,
it never ends well.

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:59.196
It's actually amazing
how much these little things pick up, huh?

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.115
Isn't it?

1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:06.032
Hey, I wanted to tell you,
you were pretty good today.

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:08.629
Thanks.

1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:11.874
Yeah, well, you're here because of me,

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:15.554
and I feel responsible for your safety.

1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:17.509
I appreciate that.

1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:20.200
You don't have to worry about me.

1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:24.479
I'm a big girl.

1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:31.195
It's not about that, it's...

1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:36.359
One wrong word, one slip and...

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.278
We have to be very careful.

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:51.712
We got into the Alcaino house, though.

1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:52.909
That was all you.

1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:56.998
Studied the family,
found out about the aunt.

1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:00.398
Speaking of aunt...

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:04.600
What was that?

1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:06.910
I thought my Aunt Vicky
was a little over the top.

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.713
I mean, Academy Award performance.

1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:12.552
"I love Latin men."

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:17.040
The headpiece like this.

1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:19.429
- You sure about that?
- I don't know.

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:22.515
Kathy, I really love your engagement ring.

1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:23.953
It is so special to me.

1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:26.548
It's been in Bob's family
for over 100 years.

1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:27.640
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:31.268
- Anyways, should we go?
- Yeah, let's do it.

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:32.360
Right.

1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:35.750
Bob, I'm taking Kathy to buy some flowers.

1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:38.016
Hey,
what's that flower you didn't like?

1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:41.430
Lilies, because they remind me
of my grandmother's...

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:43.192
Grandmother's funeral, that's right.

1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:45.032
- No lilies then.
- Please.

1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:47.552
All right. See you later.

1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:50.200
- Bye, honey. All right, have a good time.
- Bye.

1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:56.038
How lucky are we?

1:15:56.720 --> 1:15:58.920
He used to smuggle drugs.
Then he got caught

1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:01.520
and he became one of the government's
most valuable informants

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.477
in the war against cocaine.

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:06.950
But Barry Seal's enemies
caught up with him and killed him.

1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:09.311
Tonight, three men are in custody.

1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:10.628
NBC's Brian Ross reports

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:14.156
that Seal was about to
testify for the government once again.

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:16.216
Authorities believe
machine-gun killing

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:18.549
of top drug informant Barry Seal

1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:21.757
was ordered by drug bosses
in Medellín, Colombia,

1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:23.751
who sent five men to kill Seal.

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:27.510
You know, that son of a
bitch was my friend.

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.152
He prayed with me, he sat at my table
with my wife and ate my food.

1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:38.151
I wasted my knives on the meat.

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:41.992
I gave him this ring.

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.513
Made only two of them.

1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:49.630
You should have
ripped it off that motherfucker's finger.

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:59.988
Looks like I will have to be more careful
about who I give jewelry to.

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:54.753
I'm risking my life
for pennies, man. 250 won't cut it.

1:17:55.360 --> 1:17:57.635
Come on, you knew that was the deal.
That's the max.

1:17:57.720 --> 1:17:59.756
You want more money,
get a fucking law degree.

1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:03.157
- No, no, man.
- No?

1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:05.396
- It's not like that.
- So, what is it like?

1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:08.512
You pay me or I rat.

1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:13.798
I'll fucking tell them
you're a piece of shit...

1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:17.316
I can't believe that Bob
warned me about you, you know that?

1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:20.120
I should've listened to him.
I'm such a fucking idiot, the fucking...

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.272
You shut your fucking mouth.
You fuck this up and I swear to God...

1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:27.715
What the fuck is going on?
You two coming in or what?

1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:28.835
Yeah, yeah.

1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:35.791
Shut the fuck up and follow my lead.

1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:55.441
- Who's your friend over here?
- He's family.

1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:57.436
You got some ugly family, man.

1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:04.195
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with him.

1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:07.176
- I got a problem with you, man.
- You don't got a problem.

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:09.496
- I got a problem with you.
- You don't have a problem with me, man.

1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:10.635
You don't have a problem.

1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:11.914
- No?
- No.

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.515
- It stinks in here like a fucking pig.
- Now you're talking shit.

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:22.056
What's this fucking shit you saying?
Nobody believes a word you're...

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:23.115
This is a fucking cop!

1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:31.116
This is a fucking cop, man.

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.918
Shut up! Shut up!

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.656
Come on,
you don't believe this fucking asshole...

1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:36.750
What's going on here now? Tell me.

1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:38.080
He's fucking robbing from us...

1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:41.198
- This is a fuckin' cop.
- I'm telling you.

1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:52.352
I'm going to kill you, man.

1:19:55.480 --> 1:19:58.472
- I'm gonna kill you, man. Fucking idiot.
- You're going to kill me?

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:01.791
Okay. Yeah? I don't have anything, man.

1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:03.416
- Come on, turn around...
- This is a fucking cop!

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:05.112
The money's right there. There you go.

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.111
I don't have anything.

1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:08.235
- Whoa. Whoops.
- Fuck.

1:20:08.320 --> 1:20:09.753
What is that? Green shit?

1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:16.153
This is your fucking money!

1:20:17.240 --> 1:20:18.468
Fucking asshole!

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.154
I'm so scared of you
with your dick hanging out like that.

1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:23.235
Bang!

1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:31.473
I love you, man.

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:38.719
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Then fuck me. Oh, yeah.

1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:41.234
- Fuck you.
- To fucking me.

1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:44.589
You know, I really like you, man.

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:48.036
Because the only thing I care about
is money.

1:20:57.520 --> 1:20:58.839
Oh, fuck.

1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:17.392
There's a cut
on the forehead of Sugar Baby Rojas...

1:21:17.480 --> 1:21:19.436
Move, move. Hit him, you son of a bitch.

1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:23.110
- I told you, no?
- He looks good.

1:21:37.320 --> 1:21:38.514
Whoa, whoa.

1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:40.790
- See?
- He nailed him there. Wow!

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.976
The champion got the worst of it.

1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:53.029
Dear Father in Heaven,

1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:54.951
we were cursed tonight.

1:21:56.080 --> 1:21:58.310
Colombia fell to Mexico,

1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:02.712
but we are also blessed, dear God,
that you have brought into our lives,

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:04.313
Bob and his Kathy.

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:07.513
We love them.

1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:10.954
Like family.

1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:17.717
I feel good tonight, Bob.

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:22.711
Well, it is a good night, my friend.

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:27.590
All of my cash,
this economic renaissance, this new Miami.

1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:30.274
The economy is addicted to drugs.

1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:33.909
You know who's
the biggest money launderer in the US?

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.831
Well, I thought it was me.

1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:37.715
No?

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:39.639
No.

1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:42.314
Your Federal Reserve Bank.

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:44.516
It's called the anonymous window.

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:47.751
They accept pallet loads of cash
that used to be drug pesos,

1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:51.589
hundreds of millions of dollars
from my country's central bank,

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:53.637
no questions asked.

1:22:54.440 --> 1:22:57.000
If your government
didn't have my dirty money,

1:22:57.520 --> 1:22:59.078
your economy would collapse.

1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:08.557
You know, Bob, I think
I'm going to introduce you to Pablo.

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:14.312
But there's a little problem
I need you to fix first.

1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:18.437
Alcaino says
Don Chepe's $10 million is frozen,

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.431
which is actually Pablo Escobar's money.

1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:24.559
And he doesn't give a rat's ass
that our government did it.

1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:28.076
He wants his money and it's not
gonna be over until he gets it.

1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:30.390
There's a Senate
investigation into Noriega.

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:32.596
You're not getting money
that went through Panama!

1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:35.114
Frozen is frozen. Accept it.

1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:38.356
Mark, it's fucking up our operation.

1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:39.839
We need you to fix this for us.

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:41.751
How am I gonna fix this?

1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:43.512
You want me to call Senator Kerry?

1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:45.511
"Hey, John,
could you drop your investigation

1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:47.113
"that the President has sanctioned?

1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:49.316
"'Cause, my friend Bob's
getting really upset?"

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:51.755
Reagan wants Noriega's ass.
Are you listening to me?

1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:53.472
Hey, hey. You know what Alcaino said?

1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:56.558
"That's not an answer
that keeps you alive, my friend."

1:23:56.920 --> 1:23:59.229
- Okay?
- Hey. What did you say that for?

1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:01.016
No. Wait a second, hold on.
Did he threaten you?

1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:02.678
- No.
- Did he put your neck in a noose?

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:03.949
Yeah, and he's squeezing.

1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:06.600
No, he didn't. Roberto didn't say that.
He wouldn't say that.

1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:08.033
It's Escobar.

1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:09.554
Wait a second.

1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:14.788
Bob, are you in danger from Pablo Escobar
if his money doesn't come through?

1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:36.480
Ev.

1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:38.475
I'm home.

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:41.710
Don Pablo is not happy.

1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:45.674
10 million of Don Chepe's money,
which is Escobar's money,

1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:47.353
is stuck in Panama.

1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:53.192
It seems your President Reagan,

1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:55.794
he's frozen all Panamanian accounts
in an effort...

1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:04.430
That is not an answer that keeps you alive.

1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:05.589
Daddy?

1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:07.256
You should work this out
before Don Pablo does.

1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:09.510
- Something's dripping.
- If you know what I mean.

1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:14.188
Did you cut yourself?

1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:17.833
Come here. Come here.

1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:20.511
Daddy will take care of it.
No, it's all right.

1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:22.536
- Come on, here we go.
- Are you okay, baby?

1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:23.709
Are you hurt?

1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:26.312
- I don't see any...
- No, she's not cut.

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:29.073
Okay, all right. All right, it's okay.

1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:30.832
It's all right. Here we go.

1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:33.136
- No, she's okay.
- I don't see any cut.

1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:34.229
Are you all right?

1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:36.356
Okay, that's good. Here we go.

1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:38.200
What is that?

1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:39.376
- What is it?
- I'll take care of it.

1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:41.416
- Are you okay, baby?
- Okay. It's all right. Shh, shh.

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:44.273
No, it's okay.
Just a misunderstanding, that's all.

1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:45.360
It'll be all right.

1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:47.721
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Let's go get a Band-Aid.

1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:36.716
These people are fucking nuts.

1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:40.509
I know I sound like a broken record,
but I fucking heard it and I've seen it.

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:43.433
You think you understand.
You fucking don't.

1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:46.872
These people
are not fucking cops, Bobby, all right?

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.270
They will make you die for days
and they've got fucking good at it.

1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:52.456
You know what? They cut off your fingers.
They cut off your toes.

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:54.096
They inject you
with that fucking adrenalin shit

1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:56.190
so you don't pass out before any of that.

1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.719
Man, they cut open your fucking eyes
so you can't shut them,

1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:02.120
and then they're gonna
bring in your little fucking family.

1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:04.760
They'll cut your son's head off
with a cheese wire.

1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.558
They'll do the same to your little girl.

1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:08.736
And then, they'll cut your wife's tits off
right in front of you

1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:09.896
and they won't feel a fucking thing.

1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:13.151
Last but not least,
they're gonna cut your fucking head off

1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:14.960
and send it
to your buddies down at Customs.

1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:49.278
You could have retired, couldn't you?

1:27:56.360 --> 1:27:57.998
You made a choice.

1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:04.393
And this is mine.

1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.309
Now, I hope you don't mind,
but I got you something.

1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:23.993
I saw these and, of course,
I thought of you.

1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:26.234
Roberto.

1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:33.435
They are Japanese Akoya pearls,
prized for their elegance.

1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:36.637
You don't find these in lagoons,
you have to dive deep to get them.

1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:39.075
Oh, my God, they're gorgeous.

1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:40.354
Let me help.

1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:51.993
How do they look?

1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:56.950
Like they've been stuck inside a shell
waiting to be around your neck.

1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:02.551
Roberto, thank you so much.

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:03.755
Of course.

1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:06.955
I gotta go look at it. Oh, my God.

1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:13.669
Well, you certainly know
how to make women happy.

1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:14.760
Thank you.

1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:20.508
I don't wanna talk about business
on such a beautiful day,

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:23.478
but I must have that money.

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:31.588
Escobar sent me his calling card.

1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:34.279
A bloody coffin.

1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:39.552
I apologize for my
associate's indiscretion,

1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:41.676
but as your friend,
I beg you to get him his money.

1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:43.990
Without it, he is an animal.

1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:48.153
And I'm asking you to tell Don Chepe
to deliver a message to Escobar

1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:50.800
that I do not do business under threat.

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:52.791
Well, at this point, unfortunately,

1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:56.953
neither you nor I are in a position
to dictate terms to Don Pablo.

1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:06.195
Ah! Mr. Awan.

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.676
Thank you very much
for having me to your home.

1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:10.159
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1:30:11.040 --> 1:30:14.430
Well, it's a weekend,
I'll just get right to the point.

1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:19.394
If you consider me
to be important to the bank,

1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:23.393
then please find a way
to get my client's money out of Panama.

1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:25.988
It's your government, not our bank.

1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:27.080
We can do nothing.

1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:31.392
Adjust your records to show
that my client's $10 million

1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:36.270
was deposited into your bank
before the date of the freeze.

1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:41.872
You're asking us to falsify our records?

1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:48.039
Yes, that is exactly
what I'm asking you to do.

1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:00.959
Consider it done.

1:31:01.720 --> 1:31:05.998
In exchange for our efforts,
we need you to increase your deposits.

1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:10.119
I will have Mr. Howard set up a meeting
with our European executive.

1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:13.588
Mr. Awan, I thank you.

1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:22.834
- Now, Mr. Bilgrami, as promised.
- Thank you.

1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:24.876
May I have a look?

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:26.718
I was admiring your briefcase.

1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:29.515
Of course.

1:31:31.720 --> 1:31:33.039
Renwick.

1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:34.960
Renwick.

1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:38.470
I wouldn't mind one of these.

1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:39.675
Is it expensive?

1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:42.148
Priceless.

1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:55.675
- Curtains up.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:00.549
Good to see you again, Mr. Howard.
I'd like to introduce my fiancée.

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.756
Kathy Eriksson, Mr. Chinoy.

1:32:02.840 --> 1:32:06.833
But I can assure you, Mr. Chinoy,
that my clients are all professional,

1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:10.037
as professional as anyone that BCCI...

1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:11.920
Do you like escargot?

1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:16.880
Of course, I can introduce you
to my friends whenever you want.

1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:20.032
Mr. Chinoy,
that would be greatly appreciated.

1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:22.998
Boys, enough of the working.

1:32:23.080 --> 1:32:25.719
Bob and I have an announcement to make.

1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:28.554
We've decided on a date for our wedding.

1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:30.480
October 3rd.

1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:32.136
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:32:32.160 --> 1:32:33.195
Surprise.

1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:38.115
It would just mean so much to both of us
if you could join us on our special day.

1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:39.832
Wonderful. Brilliant.

1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:41.713
- Really?
- Yes.

1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:44.595
Really.

1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:47.310
I mean, now that's our answer, the wedding.

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:49.436
It's in three weeks.
We got a lot of work to do.

1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:53.308
I already confided in Gloria.
She's totally willing to help.

1:32:53.400 --> 1:32:55.277
So, you thought of everything?

1:32:57.160 --> 1:33:00.869
Mr. Chinoy, Rudy Armbrecht is
one of our most important clients.

1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:03.480
Here, this will give you some background.

1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:04.560
Thank you.

1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:07.592
Bob, you started the meeting without me.

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:10.990
No, no, no.
Mr. Chinoy, Mr. Javier Ospina.

1:33:11.080 --> 1:33:12.496
Nice to meet you, sir.

1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:14.511
My friend, what a great pleasure
to meet you.

1:33:14.600 --> 1:33:16.955
- I've heard beautiful things about you.
- Thank you.

1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:19.076
What they did not tell me was
how handsome you are.

1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:23.595
Bob, I wanna
ask you something very quickly.

1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:26.194
This guy is the creep we gave our money to?

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:29.191
Where do you think
this guy parked his camel?

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:31.999
Okay, sit down. Yeah. Sit down.

1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:34.435
Tell me I'm not telling the truth.
Am I right?

1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:35.999
Have a seat. Have a seat.

1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:40.153
We have 30 million
parked in Charleston, South Carolina.

1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:43.352
The Bible Belt? A good place to hide money.

1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:45.198
It's where the Baby Jesus hides.

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:49.189
He only comes out at night
so he can watch the money, protect it.

1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:51.555
We could have 100 million more.

1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:55.628
But such amounts need to be concealed
to everyone but a select few.

1:33:55.720 --> 1:33:57.597
No problem, Mr. Musella.

1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:01.468
BCCI has $25 billion in assets.

1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:02.913
25 billion?

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.228
25 billion, yes.

1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:09.313
Tell me, how would you
guarantee that the funds cannot be traced?

1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:11.120
Let me put it this way.

1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:13.109
We have a protocol.

1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:18.952
All we need from you is a signature.
And don't you worry about a thing.

1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:22.356
Why, what's he gonna worry about?

1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:27.675
Bankers, all they are
is crooked men with capes.

1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:30.228
Only they have suits, like Superman.

1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.198
- Except, they're maybe like the Joker.
- Go for a walk.

1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:36.317
They are crooked thieves
with crooked cocks.

1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:37.616
Why don't you go take a walk, huh?

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:39.915
That's what they are.
Their penises are crooked.

1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:43.513
I'm gonna come back to this table,
and when I come back,

1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:44.999
I'm gonna be completely invisible.

1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:46.760
- Ospina.
- That's enough.

1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:48.593
You broke my heart, Bob.

1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:13.952
- How are you, Ospina?
- What?

1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:17.235
- I'm really good. How you doing?
- Yeah? Good.

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.394
- Would you dance with me?
- She wants to dance with me.

1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:26.040
Amigo!

1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:28.920
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna dance with you right away.

1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:44.558
Oh, oui, monsieur!

1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:06.997
That Ospina's quite a character.

1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:10.595
He can fuck whoever he wants,
as long as it's not me or my people.

1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:14.634
- Would you dance with me for a little bit?
- Okay. Oh.

1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:15.800
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:17.034
- You okay? Okay.
- I'm good.

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.797
Oh! Okay.

1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:32.920
Oh!

1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:37.079
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,
it's my bedtime.

1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:39.954
Mr. Bob, the night is still young.

1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:43.749
Yes, it is, but not for a man
who trades money in 10 time zones.

1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:45.432
Good night, Gonzalo. Get some rest.

1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:46.953
Mr. Armbrecht.

1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:49.312
Right. Okay.

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:51.355
Good night.

1:36:55.360 --> 1:36:59.399
Excuse me. Ospina, I need to
steal away my future bride, my friend.

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.073
Have a good night.

1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:08.875
I know. I know who the fuck you are, Bob.

1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:37.998
What did Ospina do?

1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:44.838
He embarrassed them.

1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:51.696
I'm gonna sit in your fucking
hotel and then I'm gonna kill you.

1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:53.056
I don't care if it offends people!

1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:55.071
What? I'm gonna kill you, man! Fuck!

1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:59.199
Hey, Mr. Bob.
We were going to have breakfast.

1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:03.114
Well, I thought with
everything that happened last night...

1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:04.553
A real tragedy.

1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:06.428
Still have to eat.

1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:08.670
- We have to get back for the wedding.
- Yeah.

1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:11.115
- You have a date?
- Yes, October 3rd.

1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:13.640
We really hope you can join us.
It would mean the world to us.

1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:15.240
We'll be there.

1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:17.360
Mijo!

1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:18.960
Nice to see you again.

1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:25.359
I'm gonna deal with the luggage.

1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:27.914
Excuse me.

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.468
Bob, this is Gerardo Moncada.

1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:34.758
Don Chepe, it's a pleasure to meet you.

1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:37.835
I hope that if
you're in Tampa on October 3rd,

1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:40.036
you would do us the honor
of attending our wedding.

1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:43.315
I will if it can be arranged.

1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:45.029
Thank you.

1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:54.794
I like Paris. Alcaino said I would.

1:39:55.960 --> 1:40:00.397
But more importantly, I like you.

1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:05.390
We are authorizing the release
of 150 million to BCCI.

1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:15.433
Thank you, Rudy.

1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.954
- Who was that young guy?
- That was Don Chepe.

1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:27.191
More importantly, the other man,

1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:29.999
is Pablo Escobar.

1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:33.273
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:34.360
I'm not.

1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:36.188
Kathy, listen to me.

1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:39.830
I'm not going back home with you right now.

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:41.990
I'm going to London to BCCI headquarters.

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:44.230
- Trust me on this, okay.
- Bob. Bob.

1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:50.308
We're supposed to get married.
We need to end this.

1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:53.432
I know, and we will.
But we can get these guys.

1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:54.760
Come on, I'll put you in a cab.

1:40:56.880 --> 1:40:57.949
Thank you.

1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:05.835
Hi.

1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:08.314
I'm Kathy.

1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:12.913
I know who you are.

1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:30.152
Are you sleeping with him?

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:35.157
You know the answer to your question.

1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:38.878
If I did, I wouldn't ask.

1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:43.436
Your name's Evelyn. He calls you Ev.

1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:48.319
You met in eighth grade, remained friends.

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:51.430
Married, had two children.

1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:56.638
You don't like loud parties
or people who brag.

1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:00.798
But you do like pineapple and pizza.

1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:06.157
You're a lucky woman.
And you don't have to worry.

1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:18.188
The last time he wore it
was on our wedding day.

1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:20.875
Well, hope it still fits.

1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:26.394
Thank you.

1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:42.200
Merci.

1:42:58.520 --> 1:42:59.896
We have a highly reliable source

1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:01.840
telling us about a huge shipment
arriving tonight

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:03.433
in the port of Miami.

1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:04.748
It could be your boys.

1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:08.833
We are talking 2,500 pounds
of pure cocaine worth $23 million.

1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:11.434
That's the largest seizure
ever in the Southeast.

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:13.715
Bonni, listen, I need more time.

1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:17.429
A bust this size right now and all
these guys will be running for cover.

1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:19.670
We can get senior management at BCCI.

1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:21.990
We can get
the founder and chairman, Abedi.

1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:23.395
But I need more time.

1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:25.596
There is a beginning, middle
and end to everything.

1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:27.597
- Bonni. Bonni...
- This is the end, Mazur.

1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:00.269
Hello?

1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:06.237
We live each day in divinity.

1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:11.952
The power and the quality of divinity.

1:44:17.520 --> 1:44:19.192
It rains on us.

1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:22.475
When we live in humility,

1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:26.553
God's providence pours into us.

1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:29.198
We are truly blessed.

1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:34.000
All of us.

1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:41.033
We live in majesty.

1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:43.112
Police, search warrant, open the door!

1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:50.674
Each and every one of us
who work on such a glorious endeavor...

1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:54.234
Police! Get down!

1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.035
Get down!

1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:58.680
God pours his infinite benevolence

1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:02.070
on Bank of Credit
and Commerce International,

1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:08.315
because we have the humility to receive it.

1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:25.029
Gloria.

1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:26.720
- Hey.
- Bob.

1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:30.074
Okay, it's all right.

1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:32.230
Roberto told me
you are the only one I can trust.

1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:35.512
You need to keep his operation alive
while he's underground.

1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:37.313
Do you even know where he is?

1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:38.400
He wouldn't tell me.

1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:40.590
He just told me that
you would know what to do.

1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:43.430
Okay, I can do it.

1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:51.874
Can I have a knife or something to...

1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:53.875
Thanks, Kathy.

1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:04.517
There are 30 distributors
holding product and money.

1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:10.635
To pick it up, you use codename Primo.

1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:12.954
I'll do what I can.

1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:15.039
Thank you.

1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.350
I feel so terrible inside.

1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:20.756
Gloria, I need to talk to you. Come here.

1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:29.674
Listen, it's too crazy right now,
there's too much going on.

1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:31.320
I think you should go back to Colombia.

1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:34.039
I can't. This won't be enough.

1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:36.077
Roberto needs the money for the lawyers.

1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:38.953
- And the US will freeze all his accounts...
- I know. I know.

1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:40.957
And try to destroy our businesses.

1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:42.752
Gloria, please, listen to me.

1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:44.717
It's too dangerous.

1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:49.476
I know it's dangerous, but I have to do it
for Bianca and for her father.

1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:55.751
Just give me a minute, please.

1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:17.036
It's like you get close to people,
you know them.

1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:23.833
Yeah, well, that's what happens
when you're doing your job.

1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:28.951
I know you don't believe that.

1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:36.271
It's not just a job.
I feel so terrible for her.

1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:37.509
I know.

1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:42.435
I know.

1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:49.878
It's enough to make me cry.

1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:56.390
Mazur, tux looks good.

1:47:57.400 --> 1:47:58.753
Kiss the bride for me.

1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:02.151
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:03.753
Sherman, get over here.

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:05.876
- She's a classic.
- Jesus.

1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:09.112
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner, Bob.

1:48:10.160 --> 1:48:11.479
Tell me sooner for what?

1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:15.394
She sent me to Washington headquarters.
She set this up.

1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:18.797
They're NBC.

1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:20.074
The wedding photographers?

1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:21.760
Yeah, they got an exclusive on the bust.

1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:22.840
Christ.

1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:25.480
So, prison isn't enough.
She wants humiliation, too.

1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:26.874
No, they want publicity.

1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:29.176
She forced me to meet with the press

1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:31.839
and now she's gunning for me
since I wouldn't give 'em your name.

1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:33.035
Well, thank you.

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:34.758
Think DEA has any openings?

1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:38.160
Hey, Bob, Bob,
can you help me with this goddamn thing?

1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:40.576
- Here, here, here, here, you're messing it up.
- All right.

1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:42.576
We only had one tie in Aguadilla,
so I never got a turn,

1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:44.352
so never learned, you know.

1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:46.936
I just hate wearing suits,
I always feel like I look like a waiter.

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:48.256
Yeah, well, run, get me a cup of coffee.

1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:49.872
Yeah, I got your creamer right here.

1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:55.757
Hey, other than when Junior was born,
this is one of the best days of my life.

1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:59.877
This is my brother-in-law, Steve.
This is Gonzalo.

1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:01.240
Nice to meet you, Gonzalo.

1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:03.720
- See you on the other side.
- All right.

1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:09.475
Wow...

1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:14.480
Hey, guys.

1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:18.354
Do you think I'm gonna get fucked later?

1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:20.954
You're gonna get fucked
like you never been fucked before.

1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:22.040
Great.

1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:41.920
Hey!

1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:47.197
- So glad you're here.
- Good to see you.

1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:51.154
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:53.831
Musella, I think you wear red.

1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:57.079
Tischler's orders.
Good guys are in white today.

1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.799
Well, then shit,
I'm wearing the wrong color over here.

1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:02.110
Just haven't had a chance
to show your true colors.

1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:03.355
You're too kind.

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:06.277
I'll be glad when this shit is done, Bobby.

1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:09.675
Yeah. One last hurdle, Dom.

1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:12.668
Armbrecht's not here.

1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:14.440
Shit.

1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:17.152
How you doing? You all right?

1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:19.033
- Move it, piss ant.
- All right.

1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:51.434
Get out of my face.

1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:11.079
What are you doing here?

1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:13.515
When the heat is on,
you get out of the fire.

1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:16.478
Except, I'm a chef, I'm always in the fire.

1:51:17.320 --> 1:51:20.073
Besides, you're not talking
to Roberto Alcaino.

1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:22.071
I am now Fernando Alvarez.

1:51:23.080 --> 1:51:24.877
Wanna see my Argentinian passport?

1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:30.192
Roberto, I'm glad you're here.

1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:36.596
But there is a part of me
that wishes you hadn't taken that risk.

1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:41.269
Without family or friends,
what kind of world would this be?

1:51:41.360 --> 1:51:43.112
There would be no reason to be alive.

1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:45.680
Hmm?

1:51:47.880 --> 1:51:49.233
It's a good day.

1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:35.068
Okay, here we go.

1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:44.798
Where's Ertz? You got eyes on Ertz?

1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:45.995
- Yeah, right here.
- Where?

1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:47.120
Just there.

1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:19.790
- Roberto.
- Surprise.

1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:25.120
Please be seated.

1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:31.430
Bob. Kathy.

1:53:32.600 --> 1:53:34.955
I'd like you to turn around and take a look

1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:38.556
at everyone that's gathered here today
to celebrate your love.

1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:02.189
Does anyone here have any reason
why this couple should not be wed?

1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:04.430
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:07.679
Here we go. Here we go.

1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:18.830
These guys first! They're right here!
Get them!

1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:22.440
Bob! Get down! Get Down!

1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:30.600
Don't move!

1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:12.000
You traitors!

1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.831
You will fucking regret this!

1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:16.160
You hear me!

1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:18.318
You'll live to regret this!

1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:28.869
Take them away.

1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:32.159
You will regret this.

1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:35.816
- Go on. Please, take 'em out.
- All right, get them out of here!

1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:38.440
Clear it out! Clear it out!
Get all the cuffed people out of here!

1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:42.514
Well,
the drug dealers have said that,

1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:45.717
your children are
the business of their future.

1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:48.437
America needs to stop this scourge.

1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:50.715
And these arrests
are a big step in that direction.

1:55:51.200 --> 1:55:53.919
A beginning to an end of those who seek...

1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.116
- Bob.
- Hey.

1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:58.111
Armbrecht was taken down at the airport.

1:55:58.200 --> 1:55:59.349
Al right. Thank you.

1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:01.513
- Good job.
- You, too.

1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:05.752
Ain't that some shit, Bob?

1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:09.216
Tischler bails when the shit goes down, and
then she shows up to take the credit, huh?

1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:11.708
- Are you surprised?
- A little.

1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:14.714
You know, you were right.

1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:17.154
Of course, I'm always right.

1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:18.720
The informant.

1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:21.910
Okay, all right, I'm 99% right.

1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:27.238
I loved Bob Musella.

1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:31.235
Me, too. Me, too.

1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:34.000
Hey, Bob.

1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:37.756
Not all your friends
went to jail today, all right?

1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:50.274
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:55.753
So, Customs is letting me keep the dress,
but not the pearls.

1:56:56.520 --> 1:56:58.875
Too bad you got jilted, you look so hot.

1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:05.793
Did you get him to talk?
I'm sorry. I'll catch you guys later.

1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:09.634
You wanna help me?

1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:12.760
Yeah.

1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:38.032
Well, it's still a pretty good ending.

1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:41.269
It was, wasn't it?

1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:02.154
Go home, Bob.

1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:16.835
You okay there?

1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:34.479
Harley, you're up next.

1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:36.793
Here, catch.

1:58:44.760 --> 1:58:46.352
- Hey.
- Hi.
