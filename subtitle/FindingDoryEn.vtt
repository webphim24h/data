00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:54.715
Hi. I'm dory. I suffer
from short-term remembory loss.

0:00:55.347 --> 0:00:57.427
-Yes!
-That's exactly what you say!

0:00:58.809 --> 0:01:01.349
Okay, okay.
We'll pretend to be the other kids now.

0:01:04.147 --> 0:01:06.147
-Hi, dory!
-Ahoy there!

0:01:06.984 --> 0:01:08.574
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

0:01:08.694 --> 0:01:10.494
Okay. I love-- okay.

0:01:10.571 --> 0:01:12.991
We'll hide
and you count and come find us.

0:01:13.115 --> 0:01:13.825
Okay, daddy.

0:01:13.991 --> 0:01:19.001
No, not daddy. I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend, okay?

0:01:19.162 --> 0:01:20.292
-Okay, daddy.
-No.

0:01:20.455 --> 0:01:23.325
-I'm hiding.
-Now count to ten.

0:01:24.459 --> 0:01:27.169
One, two, three...

0:01:28.839 --> 0:01:30.379
Four...

0:01:32.217 --> 0:01:34.797
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

0:01:36.346 --> 0:01:38.176
Mommy, can I go play with them?

0:01:38.348 --> 0:01:40.678
-Dory. Dory. Dory, honey.
-Dory. Kelpcake.

0:01:40.851 --> 0:01:42.521
Undertow, sweetie.

0:01:43.187 --> 0:01:46.227
Remember, honey, we have to
stay away from the undertow.

0:01:46.398 --> 0:01:48.568
Okay, sweetheart,
what about that rhyme we learned?

0:01:48.734 --> 0:01:51.574
We see the undertow and we say...

0:01:51.653 --> 0:01:52.613
Let's go.

0:01:52.738 --> 0:01:57.828
No. It's, "heck no."
Okay? Let's try it again.

0:01:57.993 --> 0:02:00.703
We see the undertow and we say...

0:02:00.871 --> 0:02:02.791
There's the undertow!

0:02:02.873 --> 0:02:05.543
There's the undertow.
There is the undertow.

0:02:05.709 --> 0:02:09.709
Hey, you found the undertow.
And we see the undertow.

0:02:12.841 --> 0:02:15.221
-Did I forget again?
-No, no. No.

0:02:15.260 --> 0:02:17.100
-No, sweetie. Don't worry about it.
-No biggie, kelpcake.

0:02:18.222 --> 0:02:24.062
What if I forget you?
Would you ever forget me?

0:02:24.311 --> 0:02:25.731
Oh, kelpcake, no.

0:02:25.896 --> 0:02:30.686
We will never forget you, dory.
And we know you'll never forget us.

0:02:52.756 --> 0:02:59.426
Finding
dory

0:03:11.108 --> 0:03:12.438
hello?

0:03:14.444 --> 0:03:15.954
Hello!

0:03:16.822 --> 0:03:18.622
-Did you hear that?
-What's that? Hear what?

0:03:18.782 --> 0:03:22.332
-Stan, I just heard someone say hello.
-I didn't hear anybody say hello.

0:03:22.494 --> 0:03:25.124
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.

0:03:25.956 --> 0:03:29.456
There's a lot of fish here.
Anybody could have just said hello.

0:03:29.626 --> 0:03:31.206
-Hello?
-There.

0:03:31.295 --> 0:03:32.385
-Where?
-There. There. Right there.

0:03:32.462 --> 0:03:33.512
-Where am I looking?
-There!

0:03:33.672 --> 0:03:35.552
-Oh.
-Hello!

0:03:35.674 --> 0:03:38.474
-Hello?
-Oh my goodness, it's a child!

0:03:38.552 --> 0:03:41.852
-Hi, kid. Over here. Hello?
-Hello? Hi.

0:03:42.014 --> 0:03:45.684
Hi. I'm dory. Can you please help me?

0:03:45.809 --> 0:03:48.599
Hi, dory. Are you lost?

0:03:48.770 --> 0:03:50.310
Yeah, where are your parents?

0:03:51.315 --> 0:03:53.155
I can't remember.

0:03:53.817 --> 0:03:56.987
Well we'll look around.
Are any of these fish your parents?

0:04:02.534 --> 0:04:05.954
Hi, I'm dory. Can you please help me?

0:04:06.288 --> 0:04:07.458
What?

0:04:09.124 --> 0:04:11.504
Honey, you just said that.

0:04:12.377 --> 0:04:13.997
-I did?
-Mm-hmm.

0:04:14.505 --> 0:04:19.055
I'm sorry. I suffer from
short-term remembory loss.

0:04:19.218 --> 0:04:22.008
-Oh, how awful.
-Short-term memory loss?

0:04:22.179 --> 0:04:24.889
Okay, you wait here for one second.
Okay, sweetie pie?

0:04:24.973 --> 0:04:26.473
-Stan. Stan. Stan.
-What? What?

0:04:26.642 --> 0:04:28.142
What do we do? The poor thing is lost!

0:04:28.310 --> 0:04:30.350
-What do you want me to do?
-We have to do something.

0:04:30.521 --> 0:04:33.361
-She can't remember a thing!
-She could come from anywhere.

0:04:33.524 --> 0:04:37.994
Wow, you are no help today.
Dory? Sweetie? How about we--

0:04:38.153 --> 0:04:41.073
she's gone.
Well, that's not good. Hey, dory!

0:04:41.240 --> 0:04:43.370
-Dory!
-Dory!

0:04:44.159 --> 0:04:48.369
I'm dory. I lost my family.
Can you help me?

0:04:50.874 --> 0:04:54.254
I'm dory.
I suffer from short-term memory--

0:05:00.259 --> 0:05:04.049
just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.

0:05:04.221 --> 0:05:08.271
Just keep swimming. Swimming.
What do we do?

0:05:14.439 --> 0:05:17.529
Hi. I lost my family. Can you help me?

0:05:17.568 --> 0:05:19.028
Where did you see them last?

0:05:19.194 --> 0:05:23.164
Well, funny story, but I forgot.

0:05:23.282 --> 0:05:25.202
Oh, sweetie,
do you want to come swim with us?

0:05:25.367 --> 0:05:30.367
That is the nicest offer I've gotten
all day. I think. I can't remember.

0:05:30.539 --> 0:05:33.379
Anyhoo, thanks,
but I'm looking for someone.

0:05:34.626 --> 0:05:38.246
Oh. Can't remember. Can't remember.
Can't remember.

0:05:39.798 --> 0:05:43.928
Hi! I'm dory. Was it something I said?

0:05:44.052 --> 0:05:47.062
Kidding. Okay, you're not coming back.

0:05:47.181 --> 0:05:51.941
I was looking for something and i--
okay, get it. Date night. Have fun.

0:05:52.936 --> 0:05:55.146
Well, I hope you find whatever it is
you're looking for.

0:05:55.314 --> 0:05:57.984
You and me both.
Any idea what that was?

0:05:58.650 --> 0:05:59.570
I'm sorry.

0:05:59.693 --> 0:06:00.613
I'm sorry.

0:06:00.777 --> 0:06:06.737
Okay. Guess we'll hang out another
time. Don't be a stranger, stranger.

0:06:12.497 --> 0:06:13.287
Huh?

0:06:13.457 --> 0:06:19.797
A white boat! They took my son!
My son! Help me! Please!

0:06:19.963 --> 0:06:20.963
Watch out!

0:06:23.509 --> 0:06:26.339
Oh! Oh, sorry! Are you okay?

0:06:26.970 --> 0:06:28.300
-He's gone. He's gone.
-There, there.

0:06:28.472 --> 0:06:29.472
-No, he's gone.
-It's all right.

0:06:29.640 --> 0:06:30.930
-He's gone.
-It'll be okay.

0:06:31.099 --> 0:06:33.639
No, no, they took him away.
I have to find the boat.

0:06:35.187 --> 0:06:36.437
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat!

0:06:36.480 --> 0:06:39.320
-You have?
-Uh-huh. It went this way! Follow me!

0:06:39.483 --> 0:06:42.443
Thank you! Thank you.
Thank you so much!

0:06:49.535 --> 0:06:52.005
One year later

0:06:57.334 --> 0:07:00.504
Klaus. Klaus, the piñata's drooping.

0:07:04.341 --> 0:07:08.181
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
I can fix it. Ow!

0:07:14.017 --> 0:07:15.057
Hey, marlin?

0:07:17.312 --> 0:07:19.902
Oh. Hey, guys, I was just--

0:07:20.774 --> 0:07:24.994
dory! It's not time to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.

0:07:25.153 --> 0:07:27.363
And remember, the anemone stings.

0:07:27.531 --> 0:07:29.741
Oh right. Yeah. Sorry.
Back to bed, back to bed.

0:07:34.204 --> 0:07:35.664
Hey, marlin? Ow!

0:07:35.831 --> 0:07:39.171
Back to bed! That was it.
Very simple. Bed. Back to it.

0:07:42.045 --> 0:07:42.915
Hey, marlin?

0:07:43.088 --> 0:07:46.258
And we're up. That's it.
Ready to start the day.

0:07:46.383 --> 0:07:48.553
-And we were looking for something.
-Nemo.

0:07:48.719 --> 0:07:51.049
Right. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

0:07:51.221 --> 0:07:53.561
Of course, I don't really remember
yesterday all that well.

0:07:54.266 --> 0:07:58.096
Anyway, I would say the scariest
moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.

0:07:58.187 --> 0:08:00.017
Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.

0:08:00.189 --> 0:08:02.569
No. No, there were definitely four.

0:08:02.691 --> 0:08:04.111
But last time you told it,
there were three.

0:08:04.276 --> 0:08:06.736
Son, which one of us traveled
across the entire ocean?

0:08:06.904 --> 0:08:10.204
Nemo did. Obviously we had to
cross the ocean...

0:08:10.365 --> 0:08:12.275
To find him, so you know... he went first.

0:08:15.954 --> 0:08:17.754
I guess that's true. Isn't it?

0:08:19.249 --> 0:08:23.089
Well, you made it!
You almost missed the field trip.

0:08:23.253 --> 0:08:25.713
A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips.
Where are we going?

0:08:25.881 --> 0:08:27.921
-I thought you told her.
-I did tell her!

0:08:28.091 --> 0:08:29.761
-Dory.
-Yeah.

0:08:29.927 --> 0:08:35.097
Mr. ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.

0:08:35.265 --> 0:08:42.015
So it would be best if today
you weren't exactly with the class.

0:08:42.147 --> 0:08:43.187
Oh. Why not?

0:08:43.315 --> 0:08:46.445
Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

0:08:46.610 --> 0:08:48.320
That's the one thing I can remember.
Yes.

0:08:48.445 --> 0:08:52.445
Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.

0:08:52.533 --> 0:08:56.623
And Mr. ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.

0:08:57.496 --> 0:08:59.616
In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.

0:08:59.790 --> 0:09:02.290
Poor guy.
You know, he's so overworked.

0:09:02.417 --> 0:09:03.837
-You understand.
-I totally understand now.

0:09:03.961 --> 0:09:04.461
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

0:09:04.586 --> 0:09:06.836
He wants me
to be the teacher's assistant.

0:09:07.005 --> 0:09:09.045
No, not exactly.

0:09:09.174 --> 0:09:12.144
I am so honored. I have never been
a teaching assistant before.

0:09:13.637 --> 0:09:15.597
Mr. ray! You got help.

0:09:16.348 --> 0:09:19.808
Oh. Okeydokey.

0:09:21.812 --> 0:09:23.612
-All right, kids.
-All right, kids.

0:09:23.772 --> 0:09:25.192
-Today's the day!
-Today's the day!

0:09:25.357 --> 0:09:27.977
Our field trip to the sting ray migration.

0:09:28.151 --> 0:09:28.861
Sting ray migration.

0:09:29.027 --> 0:09:31.107
Now, does anyone know
why we migrate?

0:09:33.031 --> 0:09:34.321
Come on. You got to know this stuff.

0:09:34.491 --> 0:09:37.241
Migration is about going back to...

0:09:37.327 --> 0:09:38.447
-Bed!
-Yes!

0:09:38.495 --> 0:09:39.325
-No.
-No.

0:09:39.496 --> 0:09:43.456
-The sand!
-No! Migration is about going home.

0:09:43.625 --> 0:09:45.125
-Home.
-Which is where you're from.

0:09:45.294 --> 0:09:45.964
Where you're from.

0:09:46.128 --> 0:09:47.208
Can someone tell me
where they're from?

0:09:47.337 --> 0:09:50.667
-I live by a giant rock.
-I live 3 coral caves away from here.

0:09:50.841 --> 0:09:52.341
My house is covered in algae.

0:09:52.509 --> 0:09:53.839
Where'd you grow up, dory?

0:09:53.969 --> 0:09:57.009
Me? I don't know.

0:09:58.557 --> 0:10:01.017
My family. Where are they?

0:10:05.022 --> 0:10:06.312
Can I help you?

0:10:07.232 --> 0:10:09.902
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
You see, I suffer from--

0:10:10.068 --> 0:10:11.698
short-term memory loss.

0:10:11.778 --> 0:10:15.408
How can you remember your family
if you have short-term memory loss?

0:10:15.490 --> 0:10:19.040
Good question. See, I can remember
some things because well...

0:10:19.203 --> 0:10:21.873
They make sense. Like I have a family.

0:10:22.039 --> 0:10:24.459
I know because I've-- I must have
come from somewhere. Right?

0:10:24.583 --> 0:10:25.673
Everyone has a family.

0:10:25.751 --> 0:10:28.041
I may not remember their names
and what they look like.

0:10:28.212 --> 0:10:30.422
And I may not even be able
to ever find them again, but...

0:10:31.882 --> 0:10:33.762
-What were we talking about?
-Mommies and daddies.

0:10:33.884 --> 0:10:35.514
Mommies and daddies. Right.

0:10:35.677 --> 0:10:39.557
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh!

0:10:39.723 --> 0:10:42.393
That class. Uh-oh. Why me? Okay.

0:10:42.559 --> 0:10:45.399
You guys seem a little young, but okay.

0:10:45.562 --> 0:10:48.232
You see, kids,
when two fish love each other--

0:10:48.398 --> 0:10:50.568
and we'll stop right there.

0:10:52.486 --> 0:10:55.856
Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration song coming on.

0:10:56.031 --> 0:11:00.581
Oh...

0:11:00.744 --> 0:11:04.254
Migration, migration
let's learn about migration

0:11:04.414 --> 0:11:08.254
it's nature's inspiration
to move around the sea

0:11:08.418 --> 0:11:12.298
here's a scientific promise
that a fish who's oceanodromous

0:11:12.464 --> 0:11:16.384
where did everyone go? I'm by myself
oh there they are. I'm back

0:11:16.552 --> 0:11:19.602
plus or minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning

0:11:19.763 --> 0:11:21.433
oh, kids stay away from the edge.

0:11:21.598 --> 0:11:23.768
Okay, you hear that? Okay, everybody
stay back from the edge. Come on.

0:11:23.934 --> 0:11:25.564
-Okay, that's too far.
-That's too far.

0:11:25.727 --> 0:11:27.647
Come on. Come on.
Get back over here. Back this way.

0:11:27.729 --> 0:11:30.899
-Now, I need everyone to listen to me.
-All right, listen up!

0:11:31.066 --> 0:11:33.606
-When the rays pass through here--
-the rays, gonna pass through.

0:11:33.777 --> 0:11:35.397
What do we have to be careful of?

0:11:35.571 --> 0:11:37.111
Everybody has to be careful of what?
Hmm?

0:11:37.239 --> 0:11:39.619
-The undertow!
-That's right.

0:11:39.658 --> 0:11:42.288
That's right. The under--
the undertow?

0:11:44.121 --> 0:11:48.291
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.

0:11:48.458 --> 0:11:50.628
And if you're not careful,
you can get pulled into--

0:11:50.794 --> 0:11:53.844
Mr. ray! So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?

0:11:54.006 --> 0:11:56.126
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.

0:11:56.300 --> 0:12:00.470
Something deep inside you that feels
so familiar that you have to listen to it.

0:12:00.637 --> 0:12:06.387
Like a song you've always known.
And I can hear mine now!

0:12:06.518 --> 0:12:08.808
To and fro,
our hearts know where to go

0:12:08.979 --> 0:12:11.819
beating like a drum,
it sends us back to where we're from

0:12:12.399 --> 0:12:15.149
oh... we're going home

0:12:15.319 --> 0:12:18.819
we know who we are,
and it's time to travel far

0:12:18.989 --> 0:12:22.829
for days and nights we'll roam,
to make our way back home

0:12:22.993 --> 0:12:25.793
oh... we're going home

0:12:25.913 --> 0:12:30.003
swimming to and fro,
our hearts know where to go

0:12:30.083 --> 0:12:33.253
beating like a drum, it sends us back
to where we're from

0:12:33.420 --> 0:12:36.130
we see the undertow and we say--

0:12:37.216 --> 0:12:37.756
dory!

0:12:38.342 --> 0:12:40.342
Dory!

0:12:43.722 --> 0:12:44.642
Dory! Dory!

0:12:45.891 --> 0:12:48.351
-Is she dead?
-No, she's not dead.

0:12:48.477 --> 0:12:50.847
-Aw. Oh man.
-Give her some space, everybody.

0:12:50.979 --> 0:12:53.979
The Jewel of morro bay, California.

0:12:54.107 --> 0:12:56.687
The Jewel of morro bay, California?

0:12:57.653 --> 0:12:59.533
I remembered something so i--

0:13:00.280 --> 0:13:01.780
I remembered something!

0:13:01.907 --> 0:13:03.487
I actually remembered something!
Something important.

0:13:03.617 --> 0:13:05.657
Something important?
What? What was it?

0:13:05.702 --> 0:13:09.542
I'm not sure anymore,
but I can still feel it. It's right there.

0:13:09.706 --> 0:13:11.206
All right, thank you, Mr. ray.

0:13:11.375 --> 0:13:14.795
Okay, come on. Try to remember better.
Don't be such a dory, dory.

0:13:14.962 --> 0:13:18.762
Hmm. I don't know. I-- hold on. Hold on.

0:13:19.550 --> 0:13:22.010
-Oh. Oh!
-What? Did you remember?

0:13:22.261 --> 0:13:24.551
Ugh, I don't remember.
It was something-- it was--

0:13:24.721 --> 0:13:27.811
oh, oh, oh! It was something about the--

0:13:27.933 --> 0:13:30.023
the Jewel of morro bay, California.

0:13:32.521 --> 0:13:35.191
My family! I remember my family!

0:13:35.232 --> 0:13:37.112
They're out there somewhere.
I have to find them.

0:13:37.234 --> 0:13:39.744
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys! Guys! Hello?

0:13:40.737 --> 0:13:42.817
Guys! Where are you?

0:13:42.906 --> 0:13:44.236
-Dory!
-Hello?

0:13:44.408 --> 0:13:46.738
-Dory!
-Ah! Where did you go?

0:13:47.828 --> 0:13:50.078
-You were the one to go.
-My parents. I remembered them.

0:13:50.247 --> 0:13:51.657
What? What did you remember?

0:13:51.832 --> 0:13:53.922
I remembered them! My mom. My dad.

0:13:54.084 --> 0:13:57.924
I have a family. They don't know
where I am. Let's go. We have to go.

0:13:58.088 --> 0:14:01.508
Dory, no. No! This is crazy!
Where exactly are you trying to go?

0:14:01.675 --> 0:14:04.135
To the gem of the baltic?

0:14:04.303 --> 0:14:06.643
-The Jewel of morro bay, California.
-Yes!

0:14:06.763 --> 0:14:08.893
No, dory. California's all the way
across the ocean.

0:14:09.016 --> 0:14:10.016
Then we'd better get going.

0:14:10.100 --> 0:14:13.940
How come every time we're on the edge
of this reef, one of us is trying...

0:14:14.104 --> 0:14:16.774
To leave?
For once, can't we just enjoy the view?

0:14:16.940 --> 0:14:19.530
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family?

0:14:19.651 --> 0:14:22.821
No! We've done our ocean travels.
That part of our lives is over.

0:14:22.988 --> 0:14:25.278
The only reason to travel
in the first place is so...

0:14:25.449 --> 0:14:27.619
-You don't have to travel ever again.
-Yeah, but I want to--

0:14:29.036 --> 0:14:30.906
-dory, look--
-please.

0:14:31.830 --> 0:14:36.460
All I know is that I miss them.

0:14:38.795 --> 0:14:41.875
I really, really miss them.
I didn't know what that felt like.

0:14:44.301 --> 0:14:45.641
Do you know what that feels like?

0:14:52.142 --> 0:14:54.812
Yes, I know what that feels like.

0:14:56.396 --> 0:15:02.066
I don't want to forget this.
Somewhere out there is my family.

0:15:04.905 --> 0:15:08.415
Please, marlin,
i can't find them on my own.

0:15:08.575 --> 0:15:11.825
I'll forget.
Please help me find my family.

0:15:11.995 --> 0:15:15.575
Yeah, dad, you can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?

0:15:16.500 --> 0:15:17.290
No.

0:15:20.879 --> 0:15:22.759
But I know a guy.

0:15:25.175 --> 0:15:30.005
Whoo-hoo!
Righteous, righteous, righteous!

0:15:47.489 --> 0:15:51.659
Totally sick. Totally sick.

0:15:51.827 --> 0:15:53.237
I know. Isn't it great?

0:15:53.412 --> 0:15:55.752
No! I'm gonna be totally sick.

0:15:55.914 --> 0:15:58.714
It's the California current, dude.
It's got some gnarly chop.

0:15:58.876 --> 0:16:00.376
Surf's up, dude!

0:16:01.920 --> 0:16:04.380
Hey, dude, if you're gonna hurl,
just do me a solid...

0:16:04.548 --> 0:16:07.588
Head to the back of the shell, lean out,
and go for distance.

0:16:07.759 --> 0:16:09.759
We call that "feeding the fishes."

0:16:09.928 --> 0:16:11.098
Correctamundo, squirt!

0:16:11.263 --> 0:16:15.183
And now we're looking for my parents
at the brooch of the Atlantic? Or the--

0:16:15.350 --> 0:16:16.940
-the Jewel of morro bay, California.
-Exactly!

0:16:17.060 --> 0:16:18.850
How are you gonna find your parents?

0:16:19.021 --> 0:16:20.811
Do you remember what they look like?

0:16:20.939 --> 0:16:22.769
I'm a bit new to the memory thing,
so I can't say for sure...

0:16:22.858 --> 0:16:26.568
But something tells me they were
mostly blue, with s-- maybe yellow.

0:16:26.737 --> 0:16:27.397
That sounds right.

0:16:27.571 --> 0:16:31.161
Also I'm pretty sure I'm gonna know
them when I see them. We're family.

0:16:31.283 --> 0:16:34.043
By the way crossing the ocean
is the kind of thing you should...

0:16:34.203 --> 0:16:36.203
Only do once. One time!

0:16:36.371 --> 0:16:38.791
Morro bay, California's
coming up, dudes.

0:16:39.917 --> 0:16:42.087
Whoo-hoo! Let's find my family.

0:16:42.252 --> 0:16:43.422
Go! Go! Go, go, go.

0:16:43.587 --> 0:16:45.877
-Just go, dad.
-Don't push me, Nemo.

0:16:51.386 --> 0:16:54.756
So long, little blue!
Hope you find your parents.

0:16:54.932 --> 0:16:56.772
And good luck "feeding the fishes."

0:16:58.060 --> 0:16:59.770
Too late. Already fed.

0:17:00.145 --> 0:17:01.145
Oh.

0:17:05.317 --> 0:17:08.607
This feels familiar. Mom! Dad!

0:17:08.779 --> 0:17:10.529
No. Dory! Dory! Wait! Wait.

0:17:11.281 --> 0:17:13.121
Mom! Dad!

0:17:13.283 --> 0:17:15.873
Stop yelling for a second.
Do you really think your parents...

0:17:15.953 --> 0:17:18.413
Are just gonna be floating around here
waiting for you?

0:17:18.580 --> 0:17:21.830
Well, I don't know, but there's only
one way to find out. Mom! Dad!

0:17:22.000 --> 0:17:24.630
-Yell louder, dory.
-Mom! Dad!

0:17:24.795 --> 0:17:26.505
-Sh!
-What was that?

0:17:27.130 --> 0:17:31.930
Wait. I've heard that before.
I remember someone saying, "sh."

0:17:32.094 --> 0:17:34.054
Yes, well done. That was me.
One minute ago.

0:17:34.137 --> 0:17:34.797
Sh!

0:17:36.765 --> 0:17:39.845
Please. Have you seen
my mommy and daddy?

0:17:40.018 --> 0:17:42.308
Their names are Jenny and Charlie.

0:17:42.354 --> 0:17:43.024
Sh!

0:17:45.148 --> 0:17:47.068
Jenny and Charlie.

0:17:47.192 --> 0:17:48.032
What? Jenny and what?

0:17:48.110 --> 0:17:51.030
Those are their names!
My parents are Jenny and Charlie!

0:17:51.196 --> 0:17:52.776
-Dory, wait!
-Jenny!

0:17:52.823 --> 0:17:55.163
Can't we just take a moment
to come up with a plan?

0:17:55.325 --> 0:17:57.615
-Jenny! Charlie!
-Sh!

0:17:57.786 --> 0:17:59.996
-Are you crazy?
-Sorry, she's a little excited.

0:18:00.163 --> 0:18:02.873
-Jenny! Charlie!
-Dory, stop yelling for a second.

0:18:03.000 --> 0:18:05.670
It's not a good idea
to come into a new neighborhood...

0:18:05.836 --> 0:18:08.206
And call this much attention to yourself.

0:18:08.380 --> 0:18:11.340
You don't understand. I remembered
my parent's names! Jenny! Charlie!

0:18:11.508 --> 0:18:15.178
These crabs are locals and i
get the feeling they're shushing...

0:18:15.345 --> 0:18:18.005
Us for a reason. You might wake up
something dangerous.

0:18:18.140 --> 0:18:20.230
Are you talking about like
something with one big eye...

0:18:20.392 --> 0:18:21.272
Tentacles, and a snappy thing?

0:18:21.393 --> 0:18:24.023
Well, that's very specific,
but something like that, yes.

0:18:24.188 --> 0:18:26.188
You just in general don't want to--

0:18:28.734 --> 0:18:31.744
oh my goodness. Okay.

0:18:31.904 --> 0:18:36.374
There's a mistake. We're backing away.
Let us live and we will--

0:18:36.491 --> 0:18:41.041
we'll worship you. We'll build a--
do you like a monument?

0:18:48.921 --> 0:18:53.471
Oh! Ooh! Whoa! Swim for your life!

0:19:10.901 --> 0:19:12.531
-Nemo!
-Nemo!

0:19:14.029 --> 0:19:14.489
Dad!

0:19:14.613 --> 0:19:15.703
-Nemo!
-Dad!

0:19:21.912 --> 0:19:22.912
No!

0:19:23.080 --> 0:19:25.420
Nemo, hold on to me and don't let go!

0:19:26.250 --> 0:19:27.080
Dad!

0:19:27.543 --> 0:19:28.423
No, no! No!

0:19:34.800 --> 0:19:37.430
Dory! Dory, slow down!
We're not being chased anymore.

0:19:37.594 --> 0:19:38.434
Are you sure?

0:19:42.432 --> 0:19:45.602
Jenny and Charlie. Jenny and Charlie!

0:19:46.395 --> 0:19:49.275
I just remembered their names!
We have to keep going. We're so close.

0:19:49.439 --> 0:19:50.569
-Huh?
-Nemo, are you hurt?

0:19:50.691 --> 0:19:54.281
Oh my goodness! Nemo!
Are you okay? What happened?

0:19:54.444 --> 0:19:56.114
-Not now, dory. Please!
-Oh no.

0:19:56.280 --> 0:19:58.620
-Nemo. Oh no. Oh no.
-I'm okay.

0:19:58.782 --> 0:20:00.742
Oh, Nemo. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry.

0:20:02.119 --> 0:20:04.119
Oh my goodness! Nemo, are you okay?

0:20:04.288 --> 0:20:06.248
I said, "not now." You've done enough.

0:20:06.415 --> 0:20:11.675
I have? Oh no. But I can fix it.
I can. I'll go get help.

0:20:11.837 --> 0:20:14.297
You know what you can do, dory?
You can go wait over there.

0:20:14.464 --> 0:20:18.054
Go wait over there and forget.
It's what you do best.

0:20:20.596 --> 0:20:23.636
You're right. I don't know why I thought
i could do this.

0:20:23.807 --> 0:20:28.187
Find my family. I can't do this.
I'm so sorry. I'll fix it.

0:20:28.353 --> 0:20:30.113
-I'm okay.
-Well, I'm gonna get help. Okay?

0:20:30.272 --> 0:20:34.322
Okay? I can do that. I'll be--
it'll be all right, Nemo.

0:20:37.446 --> 0:20:39.816
Hello? Someone? Hello?

0:20:39.990 --> 0:20:42.870
Anyone? Hello? Anyone?

0:20:43.035 --> 0:20:44.495
Hello.

0:20:45.662 --> 0:20:48.042
-Hello?
-I'm sigourney Weaver.

0:20:48.207 --> 0:20:51.037
Oh. Hi, sigourney. I need your help.

0:20:51.168 --> 0:20:53.168
Won't you please join us...

0:20:53.295 --> 0:20:54.715
Oh. Great, great, great.

0:20:54.880 --> 0:20:58.130
As we explore the wonders
of the pacific ocean...

0:20:58.300 --> 0:21:01.550
And the amazing life it holds within.

0:21:01.720 --> 0:21:03.890
Witness the majesty
of the beluga whale.

0:21:04.056 --> 0:21:05.516
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?

0:21:05.641 --> 0:21:06.681
Dory! There you are!

0:21:06.850 --> 0:21:09.520
Guys! I found help. Sigourney Weaver's
gonna tell us where we are.

0:21:09.686 --> 0:21:10.846
Look out!

0:21:11.021 --> 0:21:13.691
-Oh, look at this!
-No respect for ocean life.

0:21:13.815 --> 0:21:16.025
-Marlin! Nemo!
-Dory!

0:21:16.151 --> 0:21:17.241
No, no, no. Not again! Not again!

0:21:17.361 --> 0:21:18.901
Let's take her inside
and see how she does.

0:21:21.865 --> 0:21:22.525
Dory! Dory!

0:21:22.699 --> 0:21:26.369
Don't worry, dory! Stay calm.
We'll come find you!

0:21:26.537 --> 0:21:29.037
And welcome to
the marine life institute...

0:21:29.206 --> 0:21:32.826
Where we believe in rescue,
rehabilitation and release.

0:21:35.671 --> 0:21:37.211
Marlin? Nemo?

0:21:42.845 --> 0:21:45.355
Hello? Hello? Can you help me?

0:21:45.514 --> 0:21:46.894
Me help you?

0:21:55.315 --> 0:21:57.525
Huh? What's happening? Help?

0:21:57.693 --> 0:21:58.863
Looks like we're done here.

0:21:59.027 --> 0:22:01.277
Dude, cut it out. You're a scientist.
We talked about this.

0:22:01.446 --> 0:22:02.776
Oh, come on. It's funny.

0:22:08.912 --> 0:22:14.042
Oh boy. Okay. This is-- I'll be fine,
i just need to find a way out and...

0:22:23.135 --> 0:22:26.105
If I could just-- get a hold of yourself,
get a hold of yourself.

0:22:26.263 --> 0:22:29.103
You'll be fine, everything's fine,
think positively.

0:22:29.266 --> 0:22:31.016
-Hey, you.
-Oh.

0:22:31.143 --> 0:22:31.983
Spinner.

0:22:32.144 --> 0:22:34.604
Oh, thank goodness. Hi, I'm dory. I'm--

0:22:34.730 --> 0:22:36.650
name's Hank. How sick are you?

0:22:36.815 --> 0:22:37.935
Sick? I'm sick?

0:22:38.108 --> 0:22:39.108
Why else would you be in quarantine?

0:22:39.276 --> 0:22:41.236
Oh no! How long do I have?
I have to find my family.

0:22:41.361 --> 0:22:43.991
All right. Now don't get hysterical--
uh-oh. Not good.

0:22:44.156 --> 0:22:46.776
What? What is it? What happened?
What's that?

0:22:46.950 --> 0:22:48.490
That there is bad news.

0:22:48.785 --> 0:22:51.995
It's a transport tag for fish
who can't cut it inside the institute.

0:22:52.164 --> 0:22:55.294
They get transferred to permanent digs.
An aquarium.

0:22:55.459 --> 0:22:57.039
In Cleveland.

0:22:57.628 --> 0:23:02.338
Fish in here, go back in the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.

0:23:02.758 --> 0:23:05.088
Cleveland? No!
I can't go to the Cleveland.

0:23:05.260 --> 0:23:08.100
I have to get to the Jewel of morro bay,
California and find my family.

0:23:08.263 --> 0:23:10.103
That's this place.
The marine life institute.

0:23:10.224 --> 0:23:13.024
The Jewel of morro bay, California.
You're here.

0:23:13.810 --> 0:23:16.810
You mean I'm from here? My parents
are here. I have to get to them.

0:23:16.980 --> 0:23:18.190
So what exhibit are you from?

0:23:18.357 --> 0:23:21.317
Wait. I'm from an exhibit? Which one?
I have to get there.

0:23:21.485 --> 0:23:23.615
Hmm. That's a hard one, kid.

0:23:23.779 --> 0:23:27.949
Unless... nah.
Never work. It's too crazy.

0:23:28.075 --> 0:23:30.125
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.

0:23:30.244 --> 0:23:33.294
You know, I could see that?
Well, there's one thing I can think of...

0:23:33.455 --> 0:23:36.365
To help you get to your family.
If I just take--

0:23:36.542 --> 0:23:39.792
yes! Great idea. You take me
to find them. Why didn't I think of that?

0:23:39.962 --> 0:23:42.842
No, no, no. If I just take your tag...

0:23:43.006 --> 0:23:46.676
I can take your place on the transport
truck then you can go back inside...

0:23:46.844 --> 0:23:50.014
And find your family. All you have to do
is give me the tag.

0:23:50.180 --> 0:23:52.220
What tag? There's a tag on my fin!

0:23:52.349 --> 0:23:54.809
How could you forget you have a tag
on your fin?

0:23:54.935 --> 0:23:58.865
Oh no. I'm sorry. I-- I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

0:23:59.690 --> 0:24:01.270
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

0:24:01.400 --> 0:24:04.070
Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

0:24:04.194 --> 0:24:07.034
You were about to give me your tag.

0:24:07.197 --> 0:24:09.317
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

0:24:09.449 --> 0:24:10.369
So I can go to--

0:24:11.785 --> 0:24:13.495
so I can go to Cleveland.

0:24:13.662 --> 0:24:16.002
Cleveland? I hear good things about
Cleveland. Why do you want to go?

0:24:16.123 --> 0:24:18.333
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

0:24:18.500 --> 0:24:20.670
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

0:24:22.337 --> 0:24:24.417
I just want to live in a glass box alone.

0:24:24.590 --> 0:24:27.220
That's all I want. So give me your tag!

0:24:27.384 --> 0:24:28.724
Hey, man, don't touch my tag!

0:24:31.889 --> 0:24:32.679
Look...

0:24:39.062 --> 0:24:42.072
I don't work here. It's not like
i have a map of this place.

0:24:42.232 --> 0:24:43.442
A map! Good idea.

0:24:43.609 --> 0:24:46.649
You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh boy.

0:24:47.613 --> 0:24:51.283
All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me--

0:24:51.408 --> 0:24:55.038
I don't have much. I--
how about if I give you this tag?

0:24:55.412 --> 0:24:56.502
Great idea.

0:25:03.795 --> 0:25:05.795
Are you absolutely sure
that's what I said?

0:25:05.964 --> 0:25:08.764
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."

0:25:08.926 --> 0:25:09.926
-Yeah, dad.
-I said that?

0:25:10.093 --> 0:25:11.933
You said that,
dory swam to the surface,

0:25:11.970 --> 0:25:13.260
and she got taken by some--

0:25:13.430 --> 0:25:14.560
all right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

0:25:14.723 --> 0:25:17.933
I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that--

0:25:18.101 --> 0:25:21.941
I'm not positive I did. It's actually
a compliment because...

0:25:22.105 --> 0:25:25.105
I asked her to wait and I said,
"it's what you do best."

0:25:25.275 --> 0:25:28.275
So i-- oh, it's my fault!

0:25:28.445 --> 0:25:32.275
It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.

0:25:32.449 --> 0:25:34.079
What if it's a restaurant?

0:25:34.243 --> 0:25:36.583
Oy! You two! Shut it!

0:25:36.745 --> 0:25:40.575
Yeah, we're trying to sleep!
You interrupted my favorite dream!

0:25:40.749 --> 0:25:42.459
Is that the one about you
laying on this rock?

0:25:42.626 --> 0:25:44.956
-Yeah.
-Oh, that is a good one.

0:25:45.128 --> 0:25:46.798
-Oh yeah, isn't it? Yeah.
-It's one of my favorites.

0:25:46.964 --> 0:25:49.134
-Excuse us. Hello! We're trying to--
-son! Son.

0:25:49.299 --> 0:25:51.799
Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.

0:25:51.969 --> 0:25:53.009
They could pounce at any moment.

0:25:55.055 --> 0:25:56.765
They don't look very pouncy.

0:25:56.932 --> 0:25:58.482
That's what they want you to think.

0:25:58.642 --> 0:26:01.312
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.

0:26:01.478 --> 0:26:04.938
Excuse me, we're worried
about our friend. Is that a restaurant?

0:26:06.358 --> 0:26:09.818
Mate, it's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.

0:26:09.987 --> 0:26:12.107
-She is?
-It's a fish hospital.

0:26:12.281 --> 0:26:16.531
Sigourney Weaver says she'll be
rescued, rehabilitated, and released.

0:26:16.702 --> 0:26:18.702
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.

0:26:18.871 --> 0:26:20.461
-Nasal parasite.
-Anemia.

0:26:20.622 --> 0:26:22.212
All fixed up and sent on our way.

0:26:22.332 --> 0:26:24.422
Oh thank goodness.

0:26:24.543 --> 0:26:27.553
Sure, that's all right.
Don't you worry ab--

0:26:28.630 --> 0:26:30.800
-Gerald, get off the rock!
-Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off!

0:26:30.966 --> 0:26:34.836
-Get off! Now you know better! Off!
-Off! Off! Off! Off!

0:26:35.012 --> 0:26:39.852
Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the marine life institute.

0:26:40.017 --> 0:26:42.097
The Jewel of morro bay, California.

0:26:42.227 --> 0:26:46.357
She was right. It looks like
dory can do something besides forget.

0:26:46.523 --> 0:26:48.323
Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that.

0:26:48.483 --> 0:26:50.533
So how are we gonna get inside?

0:26:50.652 --> 0:26:52.202
Wait. You want to get inside mli?

0:26:52.362 --> 0:26:55.032
Desperately. Our friend is in there.
Lost, alone.

0:26:55.199 --> 0:26:57.369
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.

0:26:57.534 --> 0:27:00.584
Oh, we know a way.

0:27:00.704 --> 0:27:04.424
-You do?
-Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo. Ooo-roo.

0:27:04.541 --> 0:27:05.881
-What are they doing?
-I don't know. It sounds bad.

0:27:08.545 --> 0:27:10.205
-Are we there yet?
-Sh. Keep it down!

0:27:10.672 --> 0:27:14.472
Hank., I'm so glad I found you.
It feels like-- i-- destiny.

0:27:14.718 --> 0:27:17.508
For what must be the millionth time,
it's not destiny.

0:27:17.679 --> 0:27:19.929
Uh-oh. Have I said "destiny" before?
I'm sorry.

0:27:20.098 --> 0:27:22.178
I'm just so nervous
because I'm gonna meet my parents.

0:27:22.351 --> 0:27:24.561
I haven't seen them in I don't even know
how long because...

0:27:24.728 --> 0:27:26.898
-You see I suffer from short-term--
-short-term memory loss.

0:27:27.064 --> 0:27:28.694
Look, no more talking. Okay?
I don't like talking.

0:27:28.857 --> 0:27:31.227
I don't like chatter and questions.
And, "how are you? Oh I'm fine."

0:27:31.401 --> 0:27:34.571
"How are you? I'm fine too."
News flash -nobody's fine.

0:27:34.738 --> 0:27:35.568
Oh, I'm fine. How are you?

0:27:36.782 --> 0:27:38.912
-Hank, look, there's a map!
-Sh!

0:27:38.951 --> 0:27:41.621
The plan is you're gonna read that
and figure out where your parents live.

0:27:41.745 --> 0:27:43.575
Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland.
You got it?

0:27:43.747 --> 0:27:45.917
Got it. What was the first part again?

0:27:46.083 --> 0:27:47.383
Ugh.

0:27:47.501 --> 0:27:48.591
What? The octopus escaped again?

0:27:48.710 --> 0:27:51.300
Wow. Look at all the exhibits.

0:27:51.421 --> 0:27:53.421
How can you do this park in one day?
Seriously.

0:27:53.590 --> 0:27:54.880
-Pick one!
-Okay.

0:27:55.926 --> 0:27:57.586
Well, tell everyone to keep an eye out.

0:27:57.761 --> 0:28:01.391
We're supposed to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.

0:28:03.934 --> 0:28:06.774
Well, of course I haven't seen him.
If I was looking I'd find him.

0:28:06.937 --> 0:28:08.857
Hank! There you are.

0:28:08.981 --> 0:28:10.481
-Hurry up!
-Okay. Okay.

0:28:10.649 --> 0:28:15.899
K. It starts with a "k."
Kid z-own-y. Kid zone!

0:28:16.071 --> 0:28:17.991
No! No kids. Kids grab things.

0:28:18.073 --> 0:28:19.953
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.

0:28:20.117 --> 0:28:22.657
You lost a tentacle?
Well then you're not an octopus,

0:28:22.744 --> 0:28:24.004
you're a septopus.

0:28:24.162 --> 0:28:25.502
I may not remember, but I can count.

0:28:25.664 --> 0:28:26.964
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

0:28:27.082 --> 0:28:30.962
Journey to the-- hey, look. Shells.

0:28:33.130 --> 0:28:37.630
Hey, look. Shells!
Daddy, here's a shell for you.

0:28:37.801 --> 0:28:40.301
That's great, dory.
You found another one.

0:28:40.470 --> 0:28:42.510
-I did?
-Oh, yes, you did.

0:28:42.681 --> 0:28:44.101
You're getting good at this, dory.

0:28:47.269 --> 0:28:48.649
Hey, look. Shells!

0:28:50.147 --> 0:28:53.227
-Hey, I live there.
-Yes! Yes, indeed.

0:28:53.358 --> 0:28:56.648
-I like shells.
-That's right, dear.

0:28:58.322 --> 0:29:00.492
Do you think you could find me
another shell?

0:29:01.200 --> 0:29:02.830
Purple ones are my favorite.

0:29:04.953 --> 0:29:06.333
Okay, mommy.

0:29:07.998 --> 0:29:12.708
Mommy. Purple shell. Purple shell!
Hey, my home had a purple shell.

0:29:13.212 --> 0:29:15.342
So what? Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.

0:29:15.506 --> 0:29:17.336
No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.

0:29:17.508 --> 0:29:20.388
Purple shells were her favorite
and she had this adorable giggle.

0:29:20.469 --> 0:29:21.549
And then my dad was really friendly.

0:29:21.637 --> 0:29:23.007
And now your wacky memory's
gonna get us caught.

0:29:27.351 --> 0:29:28.641
Still think this is destiny?

0:29:28.810 --> 0:29:30.310
-Hank, we have to find my folks!
-Quiet!

0:29:37.027 --> 0:29:40.407
Ugh. Base, this is Carol.

0:29:40.572 --> 0:29:43.702
I think I might have found
that missing octopus. Over.

0:29:44.743 --> 0:29:46.083
-See what you did?
-Sorry.

0:29:46.245 --> 0:29:47.205
This could not be worse.

0:29:47.246 --> 0:29:51.416
Hmm. "Destiny." Destiny.

0:29:52.084 --> 0:29:55.884
Hank. I got a feeling.
I think we should get in the bucket.

0:29:56.046 --> 0:29:58.206
-No. Stop.
-Seriously. It says "destiny" and it is--

0:29:58.382 --> 0:29:59.922
-no, no, no, no, no.
-We've got to get in that bucket.

0:30:00.050 --> 0:30:04.350
-I'm not going with you in that bucket.
-Here...I...Go...In...The...Bucket. Bye.

0:30:06.765 --> 0:30:11.555
Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family.
Oh, good idea. Play dead.

0:30:18.277 --> 0:30:21.647
I'm sorry. I got to blink. How do you
hold your eyes open that long?

0:30:32.916 --> 0:30:35.956
Hey, guys. Wait a second.

0:30:43.010 --> 0:30:45.760
Our next guest
has been here a very long time.

0:30:45.929 --> 0:30:49.929
She's a whale shark.
Her name is destiny.

0:30:50.058 --> 0:30:51.308
Destiny? Really?

0:30:51.435 --> 0:30:54.485
You'll notice she's extremely
nearsighted and has trouble...

0:30:54.646 --> 0:30:58.896
Navigating her environment.
Oh! And here she comes now.

0:30:59.026 --> 0:31:02.486
Ooh! Destiny. You're a fish?

0:31:04.406 --> 0:31:05.866
Wait. What?

0:31:05.991 --> 0:31:08.991
-Hi! Hello there.
-Whoa! Oh. Whoa.

0:31:10.454 --> 0:31:12.124
All right, I'll go with you.

0:31:12.998 --> 0:31:16.458
-Excuse me.
-Is that blue blob talking?

0:31:16.585 --> 0:31:18.965
-Can you help me? I lost my family.
-You lost your family?

0:31:19.129 --> 0:31:20.379
Well, it's a long story,

0:31:20.464 --> 0:31:22.174
and truth be told,
i don't remember most of it.

0:31:22.299 --> 0:31:23.879
Aw, that is so sad. You poor thi--

0:31:27.304 --> 0:31:30.644
sorry. Not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.

0:31:30.807 --> 0:31:32.267
Oh, I think you swim beautifully.

0:31:32.309 --> 0:31:34.309
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.

0:31:34.478 --> 0:31:36.188
Thank you.

0:31:36.313 --> 0:31:38.823
You're welcome.

0:31:38.982 --> 0:31:40.112
Wait. Say that again.

0:31:40.234 --> 0:31:43.154
You're welcome.

0:31:43.320 --> 0:31:44.820
-Dory?
-Yes.

0:31:44.988 --> 0:31:45.988
-Dory?
-Yes.

0:31:46.114 --> 0:31:47.074
-Dory?
-Yes.

0:31:47.199 --> 0:31:48.779
-Dory!
-Yes.

0:31:48.909 --> 0:31:51.079
-You and I were friends!
-No!

0:31:51.203 --> 0:31:53.163
-Dory, it's me! Destiny!
-You know me?

0:31:53.330 --> 0:31:56.000
Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.

0:31:56.166 --> 0:31:57.786
-We were pipe pals!
-We were?

0:31:58.377 --> 0:32:01.207
-Aw, you're so pretty.
-So you know where I'm from?

0:32:01.380 --> 0:32:03.260
Yep, you are from
the open ocean exhibit.

0:32:03.757 --> 0:32:05.177
I'm from the open ocean exhibit?

0:32:05.342 --> 0:32:08.262
Then that's where my parents are.
We got to go. Can you take me there?

0:32:08.428 --> 0:32:11.098
Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

0:32:11.265 --> 0:32:14.565
Can you please keep it down
over there? My head hurts.

0:32:14.726 --> 0:32:16.686
-Who's that?
-That's my neighbor, Bailey.

0:32:16.854 --> 0:32:18.194
He was brought in with a head injury.

0:32:18.355 --> 0:32:19.435
I know you're talking about me, destiny.

0:32:19.606 --> 0:32:21.726
He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...

0:32:21.900 --> 0:32:23.940
The doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

0:32:24.111 --> 0:32:26.031
Hear every word
you're saying about me.

0:32:26.154 --> 0:32:27.204
What's echolocation?

0:32:27.364 --> 0:32:30.284
Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...

0:32:30.450 --> 0:32:35.500
Find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."

0:32:35.622 --> 0:32:39.382
Now I know you're talking about me.
I really can't echolocate.

0:32:39.543 --> 0:32:41.253
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

0:32:41.420 --> 0:32:44.460
I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!

0:32:44.631 --> 0:32:46.931
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

0:32:47.092 --> 0:32:51.512
Echolocation. Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?

0:32:51.555 --> 0:32:52.725
-What?
-What are glasses?

0:32:52.848 --> 0:32:57.518
It's sort of like you go, "hoo" and then
you see things. Why do I know that?

0:32:57.644 --> 0:33:00.064
Oh. That's interesting.

0:33:02.733 --> 0:33:05.443
There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.

0:33:05.611 --> 0:33:08.111
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

0:33:08.280 --> 0:33:10.320
Wait, no. I know where my parents are.
They're in the--

0:33:10.490 --> 0:33:13.330
what's it called? The place--
the soap and lotion?

0:33:13.493 --> 0:33:15.163
-Open ocean.
-Open ocean!

0:33:15.329 --> 0:33:17.789
Open ocean! I know where that is.

0:33:17.956 --> 0:33:21.076
That's the exhibit located right next to--
i don't care.

0:33:21.251 --> 0:33:22.091
Easy!

0:33:22.169 --> 0:33:25.089
If you're trying to get to the open ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.

0:33:25.255 --> 0:33:27.465
-Through the pipes. Great.
-Through the pipes?

0:33:27.633 --> 0:33:29.633
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

0:33:29.801 --> 0:33:33.891
Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's--
did you get that, Hank? All that?

0:33:34.014 --> 0:33:35.934
-Yeah.
-Great! Let's go.

0:33:36.433 --> 0:33:39.523
I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.

0:33:43.273 --> 0:33:48.323
That's-- I'm-- i-- see, I can't because
I'm not so good with directions.

0:33:48.487 --> 0:33:51.527
Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?

0:33:51.698 --> 0:33:53.658
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

0:33:53.825 --> 0:33:56.655
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

0:33:56.787 --> 0:33:59.707
-Not my problem. Tag!
-But I can't get in that way.

0:33:59.831 --> 0:34:02.131
-I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
-There's no other way.

0:34:04.795 --> 0:34:08.135
-There's no other way.
-Now, now. Don't panic.

0:34:08.298 --> 0:34:12.338
It's okay. Not everything in life is
easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?

0:34:12.511 --> 0:34:16.641
She's right. When something's
too hard, you should just give up.

0:34:16.807 --> 0:34:18.727
-Charlie!
-A joke. I'm kidding!

0:34:18.892 --> 0:34:22.522
Just a joke. A joke.
Caution, joker at work.

0:34:22.688 --> 0:34:23.978
Joke. I got it.

0:34:24.147 --> 0:34:27.317
You see, kelpcake?
There's always another way.

0:34:29.361 --> 0:34:30.861
Thank you, daddy.

0:34:32.155 --> 0:34:36.325
Thank you, daddy. Nope. My father
said there's always another way.

0:34:36.410 --> 0:34:39.500
-What? There is no other way.
-Open ocean. Open ocean.

0:34:40.080 --> 0:34:43.250
Open ocean. I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.

0:34:43.333 --> 0:34:46.593
That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.

0:34:46.753 --> 0:34:48.713
-Wait, what?
-Always another way. There's--

0:34:48.881 --> 0:34:52.841
there! Guys, follow me. I know
how we can get to locomotion.

0:34:53.010 --> 0:34:54.340
-Open ocean.
-Exactly.

0:34:55.095 --> 0:34:57.095
Guys. You know I can't swim
over there, right?

0:34:59.600 --> 0:35:02.520
Ooo-roo, ooo-roo, ooo-roo.

0:35:02.603 --> 0:35:06.113
I don't see how this is going to get us
inside. What are you even doing?

0:35:06.273 --> 0:35:08.023
We're calling her over, of course.

0:35:08.192 --> 0:35:09.942
Calling her over? Calling who over?

0:35:14.823 --> 0:35:16.993
Lads, meet Becky.

0:35:18.869 --> 0:35:22.619
Flying? No, no, no new information.

0:35:22.789 --> 0:35:26.539
Listen, tell her thank you. You guys
have gone above and beyond. Really.

0:35:26.710 --> 0:35:30.920
But is there a way to get in
that involves, like, swimming?

0:35:31.089 --> 0:35:32.469
Because that's really our strength.

0:35:32.549 --> 0:35:35.179
Look, your friend is going to be
in quarantine.

0:35:35.302 --> 0:35:37.392
That's where they take the sick fish.

0:35:37.471 --> 0:35:41.021
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.

0:35:44.102 --> 0:35:48.442
Hi, Becky. Ow! Stop. Let's call
her pecky because this is hurting.

0:35:48.607 --> 0:35:49.937
I think she likes you, dad.

0:35:50.108 --> 0:35:55.068
Becky, love? These two nice fish
need to get into quarantine.

0:35:55.239 --> 0:35:57.069
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?

0:35:57.199 --> 0:36:00.949
Becky, is-- would that work
with your schedule? Ow!

0:36:01.119 --> 0:36:02.869
She doesn't understand
what I'm saying.

0:36:02.996 --> 0:36:05.576
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.

0:36:05.707 --> 0:36:07.327
-Imp-- what?
-Imprint.

0:36:07.501 --> 0:36:11.591
Look her in the eye and say, "ooo-roo"
and she'll be in sync with you.

0:36:11.755 --> 0:36:14.835
-Now look her in the eye.
-Yeah.

0:36:15.467 --> 0:36:18.927
Nemo, I think we should devise
an alternate plan.

0:36:19.096 --> 0:36:21.766
One that involves staying in the water
and someone sane.

0:36:21.932 --> 0:36:24.982
Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!

0:36:25.143 --> 0:36:27.943
That's fine, dad. And in the meantime,
dory will just forget us.

0:36:28.105 --> 0:36:29.985
Like you said, it's what she does best.

0:36:30.148 --> 0:36:31.778
Fine.

0:36:34.278 --> 0:36:38.738
Okay, look her in the eye. Which eye?

0:36:38.866 --> 0:36:40.116
Just pick one, mate.

0:36:40.284 --> 0:36:41.124
Becky.

0:36:46.456 --> 0:36:51.126
Ooh. Ooo-roo. Roo-roo, Becky.

0:36:53.839 --> 0:36:56.339
Okay, this is all great.

0:36:57.801 --> 0:37:00.721
How exactly is Becky
supposed to carry us?

0:37:00.846 --> 0:37:04.636
Oh yeah. I almost forgot. Gerald!

0:37:04.808 --> 0:37:06.388
-Hmm?
-Yeah, Gerald.

0:37:06.560 --> 0:37:08.190
-Come on, son.
-Hmm?

0:37:08.687 --> 0:37:12.977
Come on, Gerald. Give us your pail,
we'll let you sit on the rock.

0:37:13.150 --> 0:37:15.820
-Yeah, Gerald. We swear it.
-Hmm.

0:37:17.654 --> 0:37:20.414
That's right. Shimmy on over here.

0:37:20.574 --> 0:37:22.584
Come on. You can do it.

0:37:23.327 --> 0:37:24.407
That's right.

0:37:24.578 --> 0:37:26.038
Mind you don't scuff your bum.

0:37:28.832 --> 0:37:31.582
Thank you so much, Gerald.

0:37:31.752 --> 0:37:34.382
Welcome to your time on this rock.

0:37:35.923 --> 0:37:37.053
Comfortable, isn't it?

0:37:38.675 --> 0:37:41.755
-Time's up! Get off! Off! Off! Off! Off!
-Time's up! Now get off, Gerald! Off!

0:37:41.887 --> 0:37:46.177
No, this is nuts! Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?

0:37:46.225 --> 0:37:47.275
Good luck!

0:37:52.439 --> 0:37:54.069
Okay, when I tell you you're gonna--

0:37:54.233 --> 0:37:56.113
yeah. I know. I'm gonna signal
with a big splash.

0:37:56.276 --> 0:38:00.856
On my mark. Not clear yet.
Not clear yet.

0:38:01.323 --> 0:38:03.583
-Now?
-Not 'til destiny gives the signal.

0:38:05.118 --> 0:38:08.248
You know something? I have no idea
why you're even doing this.

0:38:09.373 --> 0:38:10.213
What do you mean?

0:38:10.374 --> 0:38:12.214
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.

0:38:12.376 --> 0:38:14.206
If I had short-term memory loss...

0:38:14.378 --> 0:38:16.208
I'd just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.

0:38:16.380 --> 0:38:18.050
Well I don't want to do that.
I want my family.

0:38:18.215 --> 0:38:20.265
Not me, kid. I don't want anyone
to worry about.

0:38:20.801 --> 0:38:24.721
You're lucky. No memories.
No problems.

0:38:24.888 --> 0:38:28.018
Huh. No memories. No problems.

0:38:28.058 --> 0:38:31.308
Still not clear. Still not clear.

0:38:31.478 --> 0:38:32.808
You don't have to say when it's not time.

0:38:32.980 --> 0:38:34.310
-Not--
-just tell me when it is time.

0:38:34.481 --> 0:38:36.231
Okay, here we go. And-- wait!

0:38:36.400 --> 0:38:38.070
"Here we go. Wait." Are you serious?

0:38:38.235 --> 0:38:39.865
-Okay, on the count of three.
-Don't count. Just say, "go."

0:38:39.987 --> 0:38:41.737
-Go! Now, now. Do it! Do it!
-What? Okay, okay.

0:38:42.322 --> 0:38:44.622
-Wow. Look at that! I mean--
-that's the signal.

0:38:44.741 --> 0:38:45.871
Go, go, go! That's the signal!

0:38:51.582 --> 0:38:56.092
Now remember, destiny said follow
the signs to the open ocean exhibit.

0:38:56.253 --> 0:38:59.763
I can't see squat,
so it's your job to look for it.

0:38:59.923 --> 0:39:01.263
Got it. Follow the signs to open ocean.

0:39:01.300 --> 0:39:03.590
I'm just gonna repeat it, okay?
That should work.

0:39:03.635 --> 0:39:06.505
Follow the signs to open ocean.
Follow the signs to open ocean.

0:39:06.597 --> 0:39:09.427
Mm. Go right! Follow the signs
to open ocean.

0:39:09.516 --> 0:39:12.936
Follow the signs to open ocean.
Follow the signs to open ocean. Left!

0:39:13.103 --> 0:39:15.023
-Follow the signs to open ocean.
-And steer clear of people, will you?

0:39:15.189 --> 0:39:17.399
Especially kids.
I don't want to be touched.

0:39:17.441 --> 0:39:18.981
Sh! Do not mess me up!

0:39:21.612 --> 0:39:25.032
Oh, poor baby. Let me get that for you.
Here you-- oh!

0:39:26.533 --> 0:39:27.623
Oh my.

0:39:28.702 --> 0:39:30.622
Where do we go? Where do we go?

0:39:30.787 --> 0:39:33.667
Oh, sorry!
Okay, I was looking, looking...

0:39:33.832 --> 0:39:36.582
Roo-roo, Becky! Drop us anywhere.
We're okay.

0:39:36.710 --> 0:39:39.840
Just wait, dad. I think she's looking
for a place to land.

0:39:40.005 --> 0:39:43.675
She's confused, Nemo. She doesn't
even know which way to look.

0:39:50.140 --> 0:39:54.310
Wait, Becky. What are you doing?
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo-roo-roo.

0:39:55.729 --> 0:39:59.149
Okay. I was going somewhere.
The question is where.

0:39:59.316 --> 0:40:01.646
Which way? Do you see the sign?

0:40:01.693 --> 0:40:04.653
I'm looking. I'm looking. Something to
something gets me to my family!

0:40:04.738 --> 0:40:07.278
"The world's most powerful pair of--"

0:40:07.407 --> 0:40:10.407
I know that. Why do I know that?
It's another memory.

0:40:10.577 --> 0:40:13.197
Hank, we need to go that way!
Left. Go left.

0:40:17.334 --> 0:40:20.004
Becky! Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

0:40:20.087 --> 0:40:22.047
She can't hear you, dad.

0:40:22.130 --> 0:40:26.010
All right. New plan. We have to
get closer to Becky so she can hear us.

0:40:27.010 --> 0:40:28.850
I don't think we should move the pail.

0:40:29.471 --> 0:40:33.021
Nemo. Without me Becky's lost.

0:40:33.517 --> 0:40:35.187
Dad, just trust her.

0:40:35.269 --> 0:40:38.229
Trust her? So she can forget us
all together?

0:40:38.397 --> 0:40:42.027
-I trust Becky.
-You trust her? Becky's eating a cup!

0:40:44.027 --> 0:40:47.357
Becky! Becky! Ooo-roo! Whoa!

0:40:55.122 --> 0:40:58.462
Well, at least we're not stuck
in the bucket anymore.

0:41:03.505 --> 0:41:05.125
Or on top of quarantine.

0:41:06.008 --> 0:41:07.468
The baby otter talk is beginning now.

0:41:07.634 --> 0:41:12.064
Why, thanks, sigourney Weaver.
Hey, who wants to learn about otters?

0:41:12.222 --> 0:41:15.562
Looking for the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

0:41:15.893 --> 0:41:17.063
Otters!

0:41:17.227 --> 0:41:19.307
-Welcome, it's a huge cuddle party!
-Cuddle party! I'm in!

0:41:21.565 --> 0:41:24.235
Where are we?
Are we close to open ocean?

0:41:24.401 --> 0:41:26.781
Yes. I think-- well, I don't know.
But I saw that other sign so--

0:41:26.945 --> 0:41:27.895
what? What other sign?

0:41:28.071 --> 0:41:29.411
The world's most powerful pair
of glasses.

0:41:29.573 --> 0:41:32.283
What? What are you talking about?
Why would we follow that sign?

0:41:32.409 --> 0:41:34.619
Well, because I remembered it.

0:41:34.745 --> 0:41:36.505
No. That wasn't the plan. Ow!

0:41:38.582 --> 0:41:41.502
All right, that's it!
You have wasted my time!

0:41:41.585 --> 0:41:43.675
-Wait. No.
-That transport truck leaves at dawn...

0:41:43.837 --> 0:41:45.627
And I'm not missing it,
so give me your tag.

0:41:45.797 --> 0:41:47.257
Wait. No, I remembered that sign.

0:41:47.424 --> 0:41:49.054
-So?
-So I'm remembering more...

0:41:49.092 --> 0:41:51.432
And more and I feel like my memory's
getting better. I think we should--

0:41:51.595 --> 0:41:54.265
no! Your memory is not working.
You can't remember anything.

0:41:54.431 --> 0:41:57.101
It's probably how you lost your family
in the first place!

0:41:59.978 --> 0:42:03.858
All right, look, let's just take it down
a notch. Just give me the tag and--

0:42:04.024 --> 0:42:07.284
you know something, for a guy with
three hearts you're not very nice.

0:42:07.444 --> 0:42:09.654
Three hearts? What are you
talking about? I don't have three hearts.

0:42:09.738 --> 0:42:10.948
-Yes, you do.
-I don't!

0:42:10.989 --> 0:42:11.779
-You do!
-Don't!

0:42:11.949 --> 0:42:13.069
-Do!
-Stop saying that!

0:42:13.200 --> 0:42:16.330
Fun fact- the octopus has three hearts.

0:42:16.411 --> 0:42:18.621
Two pump blood to the gills
while the third pumps...

0:42:18.747 --> 0:42:19.907
-Blood throughout the body.
-Wait!

0:42:21.792 --> 0:42:23.002
Kid zone

0:42:24.127 --> 0:42:25.997
you know, someone with three hearts
shouldn't be so mean.

0:42:26.088 --> 0:42:28.548
And it's mean to say that
i would lose someone I love!

0:42:28.632 --> 0:42:29.302
Touch
pool

0:42:29.758 --> 0:42:33.048
I did not lose them! Hank?

0:42:34.388 --> 0:42:37.018
Hank? Hank?

0:42:37.558 --> 0:42:40.478
-Han-s.
-No. Not hans. I'm looking for Hank.

0:42:40.644 --> 0:42:42.814
-Han-s.
-Hank. With a "k." Hank.

0:42:42.980 --> 0:42:46.150
-Hands!
-Hands? Oh, oh, oh, hands!

0:42:49.194 --> 0:42:51.784
Hank! Hank?

0:42:51.905 --> 0:42:52.855
My arm!

0:42:52.948 --> 0:42:53.658
Hank!

0:42:57.160 --> 0:43:01.000
Where are you? Hank! Oh! Can you
please help me? I'm looking for--

0:43:03.333 --> 0:43:05.503
please help me. I've lost
my friend frank. I'm sorry, not frank.

0:43:05.669 --> 0:43:06.749
You're in my space!

0:43:07.421 --> 0:43:10.221
He's an octopus. No, septo--
septopus. That's right.

0:43:10.382 --> 0:43:12.382
He's a septopus. Septopus.
Septopus. Septopus.

0:43:13.051 --> 0:43:16.051
One, two, three, four, five, six, s--
septopus! He's camouflaged!

0:43:19.183 --> 0:43:21.433
Hank. Come on, Hank!
Let's get out of here.

0:43:21.602 --> 0:43:23.192
Dory, what are you doing?

0:43:23.687 --> 0:43:27.067
Hank! What's the plan?

0:43:27.232 --> 0:43:29.362
The plan is I'm gonna stay here forever.

0:43:29.526 --> 0:43:30.816
Okay. Good plan.

0:43:33.113 --> 0:43:35.873
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry.
I can't remember right.

0:43:37.159 --> 0:43:39.159
-Sweetie. Sweetie.
-Oh, watch out, kelpcake.

0:43:39.286 --> 0:43:40.536
Oh, watch where you're going.

0:43:41.413 --> 0:43:45.753
I'm sorry, daddy.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.

0:43:45.876 --> 0:43:50.376
Oh, sweetie.
Sweetie, you don't need to be sorry.

0:43:50.547 --> 0:43:54.967
You know what you need to do?
Just keep swimming.

0:43:55.135 --> 0:43:56.135
Yeah.

0:43:56.303 --> 0:43:59.433
And I bet you can remember that
because we're just--

0:44:00.974 --> 0:44:02.394
we're gonna sing a song about it.

0:44:02.559 --> 0:44:05.399
Just keep swimming
just keep swimming

0:44:05.562 --> 0:44:08.112
just keep swimming
swimming, swimming

0:44:08.273 --> 0:44:10.153
what do we do?
We swim

0:44:10.317 --> 0:44:13.237
swim, swim, swim
we swim

0:44:13.403 --> 0:44:15.993
-we swim, swim, swim
-just keep swimming

0:44:19.409 --> 0:44:22.159
my parents taught me that song!
We sang it as a family.

0:44:22.329 --> 0:44:23.749
All this time I thought I made it up!

0:44:23.914 --> 0:44:25.584
-What song?
-Just keep swimming.

0:44:25.749 --> 0:44:27.749
Hank, we've just got to keep swimming.

0:44:27.918 --> 0:44:31.208
What? No way! Listen to me,
it's too dangerous to move.

0:44:31.338 --> 0:44:34.168
No, you listen to me. I know
you're scared, but you can't give up.

0:44:34.299 --> 0:44:35.339
Follow me.

0:44:35.509 --> 0:44:37.969
Just keep swimming
just keep swimming

0:44:39.012 --> 0:44:41.512
my mom wrote this song for me

0:44:42.266 --> 0:44:44.426
it's gonna get us out of here

0:44:44.601 --> 0:44:46.021
sing with me, Hank. Come on.

0:44:47.104 --> 0:44:48.984
I'm coming, mommy.
I'm coming, daddy!

0:44:49.106 --> 0:44:50.766
-We're gonna be okay.
-Stop!

0:44:50.941 --> 0:44:52.321
-Huh?
-Turn back.

0:44:52.442 --> 0:44:53.652
Turn back!

0:44:53.819 --> 0:44:58.659
You're headed right for poker's cove.
Poker's cove.

0:44:59.366 --> 0:45:01.486
-Poker's cove?
-Incoming!

0:45:05.122 --> 0:45:06.122
Stop it!

0:45:06.290 --> 0:45:07.790
Oh, what is this?

0:45:11.962 --> 0:45:12.802
Sorry.

0:45:12.963 --> 0:45:15.303
That's okay. Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

0:45:20.470 --> 0:45:23.220
Hank? Oh, Hank. There you are.

0:45:24.057 --> 0:45:26.557
Wow. You got us out of there.

0:45:27.227 --> 0:45:29.397
Huh. I did.

0:45:31.106 --> 0:45:31.896
I got us out of there.

0:45:33.358 --> 0:45:34.528
I mean, technically
you also got us in there.

0:45:35.527 --> 0:45:38.697
But if you hadn't I'm not sure
we would have gotten here.

0:45:38.780 --> 0:45:39.450
Echolocation

0:45:39.489 --> 0:45:40.489
the world's most
powerful pair of glasses

0:45:41.241 --> 0:45:44.201
echolocation. Echolocation!

0:45:44.369 --> 0:45:47.789
The world's most powerful pair
of glasses. We found it!

0:45:47.915 --> 0:45:50.045
No. You found that.

0:45:55.547 --> 0:45:58.167
Welcome to the open ocean.

0:45:58.675 --> 0:45:59.625
Home.

0:46:02.763 --> 0:46:07.523
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo.
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

0:46:07.643 --> 0:46:09.603
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

0:46:09.770 --> 0:46:11.440
Dad, stop. She's not coming back.

0:46:11.605 --> 0:46:13.065
She might. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

0:46:13.148 --> 0:46:15.278
Dad! You made her feel like
she couldn't do it.

0:46:22.366 --> 0:46:24.366
You're not talking
about Becky, are you?

0:46:26.703 --> 0:46:28.083
I miss dory.

0:46:28.705 --> 0:46:29.955
Me too.

0:46:34.378 --> 0:46:36.958
The truth is,
I'm just so worried about her.

0:46:37.714 --> 0:46:39.554
She's the one who should be worried
about us.

0:46:40.217 --> 0:46:43.217
Well, she would definitely have an idea
of what to do if she were here.

0:46:44.137 --> 0:46:45.557
I don't know how she does that.

0:46:45.722 --> 0:46:49.562
I don't think she knows, dad.
She just does.

0:46:49.726 --> 0:46:52.396
Well, then we'll just have to think.

0:46:53.730 --> 0:46:56.070
-What would dory do?
-What would dory do?

0:46:56.233 --> 0:46:58.153
Yeah! What would dory do?

0:46:58.819 --> 0:47:01.609
She would assess her situation,
and then she'd evaluate...

0:47:01.780 --> 0:47:03.490
Then she would analyze her options--

0:47:03.657 --> 0:47:06.237
dad, that's "what would marlin do."

0:47:06.368 --> 0:47:08.748
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.

0:47:08.912 --> 0:47:11.002
She would just look at the first thing
she sees and--

0:47:23.760 --> 0:47:24.930
dory would do it.

0:47:28.640 --> 0:47:31.940
Nemo, hold on to me. Whoa!

0:47:35.272 --> 0:47:38.442
Hey, it's working! Whoa!

0:47:42.738 --> 0:47:46.448
Just keep gasping.

0:47:52.456 --> 0:47:54.996
-Are you okay?
-Yeah! What would dory do now?

0:47:55.167 --> 0:47:56.127
Who's dory?

0:47:58.545 --> 0:47:59.625
Oh boy. Are we happy to see you.

0:47:59.713 --> 0:48:02.053
Happy to see me? I'm happy to see you!

0:48:02.216 --> 0:48:04.836
I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.

0:48:05.010 --> 0:48:06.680
Years? Wow.

0:48:06.762 --> 0:48:08.892
Unfortunately we can't stay long.
We have to go because--

0:48:09.056 --> 0:48:11.676
now why would you want to go?
You just landed.

0:48:11.850 --> 0:48:14.810
Stay a while. Tell me all about yourself.

0:48:14.978 --> 0:48:17.688
I would love to, but my son and i
have to get to quarantine, so--

0:48:17.856 --> 0:48:19.896
-wonderful thing to have a son.
-Yeah it is.

0:48:20.067 --> 0:48:23.147
Of course I don't have a family.
I dated a nice scallop for a while.

0:48:23.320 --> 0:48:25.160
-That's fascinating, but--
-but scallops have eyes.

0:48:25.322 --> 0:48:27.372
And she was looking for something
different. I'm kidding!

0:48:27.533 --> 0:48:29.493
Well, not about scallops having eyes.
They do.

0:48:29.660 --> 0:48:31.910
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.

0:48:32.079 --> 0:48:36.419
Oh, shelley! Why? Why?

0:48:36.583 --> 0:48:37.713
Now what would dory do?

0:48:41.046 --> 0:48:44.666
Come with us as we explore the
mysterious world of the open ocean.

0:48:46.385 --> 0:48:48.855
-Okay, Hank, follow me.
-You're in a cup.

0:48:49.012 --> 0:48:50.432
Right. I'll follow you then.

0:49:01.942 --> 0:49:05.362
-Wait.
-An octopus has three hearts.

0:49:06.905 --> 0:49:07.695
Huh. That's a fun fact.

0:49:18.917 --> 0:49:21.957
-We're here. This is really happening.
-Sh!

0:49:32.431 --> 0:49:35.931
Well, looks like this is it, kid.
Now I got a truck to catch.

0:49:36.101 --> 0:49:38.441
Wait! Wait! I had something for you.

0:49:40.939 --> 0:49:44.229
-Tag.
-The tag. Right!

0:49:51.116 --> 0:49:54.406
You know,
i think I'm gonna remember you.

0:49:57.080 --> 0:49:59.250
Oh, you'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.

0:49:59.750 --> 0:50:01.000
Three heartbeats.

0:50:02.336 --> 0:50:03.996
I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.

0:50:09.426 --> 0:50:11.136
My parents are actually down there.

0:50:16.808 --> 0:50:17.928
You okay?

0:50:19.436 --> 0:50:20.346
I'm ready.

0:50:21.104 --> 0:50:23.734
Yeah, I think you are.

0:50:29.947 --> 0:50:31.107
Wow!

0:50:34.993 --> 0:50:39.123
Where are they? Where are they?
Where are they? Okay. Okay.

0:50:44.795 --> 0:50:49.925
Pardon me. Oh. Hi. Hello. Have you
seen a mom and a dad without me?

0:50:50.092 --> 0:50:53.142
Excuse me. Have you seen a couple?
They're old like you.

0:50:53.303 --> 0:50:56.973
Not old like you,
but older than you even. Okay. Bye.

0:50:57.140 --> 0:51:02.310
Hi. Do you know anyone who lost a kid
a long time ago that would be me?

0:51:02.479 --> 0:51:05.609
I don't know how long ago exact--
okay. You're in a hurry.

0:51:05.732 --> 0:51:07.942
-Ho, ho! Watch where you're going.
-Oh sorry.

0:51:14.950 --> 0:51:18.540
It's our goal that every animal
we rescue and care for...

0:51:18.704 --> 0:51:21.164
Will eventually return home
to where they belong.

0:51:26.170 --> 0:51:27.340
Shells.

0:51:27.504 --> 0:51:31.474
And there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, dory...

0:51:31.633 --> 0:51:33.393
You just follow the shells.

0:51:33.552 --> 0:51:35.012
Hey, look! Shells!

0:51:42.686 --> 0:51:44.646
Follow the shells.

0:51:56.533 --> 0:51:59.333
-Hey, I live there.
-Yes, yes indeed.

0:52:00.871 --> 0:52:02.831
My home. That's my home!

0:52:04.208 --> 0:52:05.998
Mom! Dad!

0:52:07.544 --> 0:52:10.214
Okay, kelpcake. Now count to ten.

0:52:11.089 --> 0:52:13.719
One, two, three...

0:52:15.010 --> 0:52:15.970
Four...

0:52:16.553 --> 0:52:18.893
You're welcome.

0:52:19.056 --> 0:52:20.766
Who are you talking to, kelpcake?

0:52:20.933 --> 0:52:22.683
My pipe pal, destiny!

0:52:27.064 --> 0:52:29.574
Mom? Dad?

0:52:38.742 --> 0:52:40.452
Mommy loves purple shells.

0:52:48.544 --> 0:52:52.094
-Mommy?
-What's going to happen to her?

0:52:52.256 --> 0:52:54.006
There, there, Jenny.

0:52:54.591 --> 0:52:57.181
Oh no, don't cry, mommy. Don't cry.

0:52:57.261 --> 0:53:00.351
Do you think she's-- that she can
make it on her own, Charlie?

0:53:00.430 --> 0:53:03.390
Oh, honey. It'll be okay.

0:53:06.103 --> 0:53:07.943
Mommy loves purple shells.

0:53:18.448 --> 0:53:19.738
-Dory!
-Dory?

0:53:19.908 --> 0:53:21.488
-Dory!
-Mommy?

0:53:22.744 --> 0:53:25.584
-Dory!
-Mommy! Daddy!

0:53:28.750 --> 0:53:30.170
My parents...

0:53:31.461 --> 0:53:33.671
I... I lost them.

0:53:42.139 --> 0:53:43.969
It was my fault.

0:53:44.975 --> 0:53:46.645
-Where's your tag?
-Huh?

0:53:46.810 --> 0:53:50.610
Your tag. It's missing.
That why you're not in quarantine?

0:53:50.731 --> 0:53:51.901
-Quarantine?
-Yeah!

0:53:52.024 --> 0:53:55.154
That's where they took all
the blue tangs. Isn't that right, bill?

0:53:55.319 --> 0:53:58.319
Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

0:53:58.488 --> 0:54:01.658
Being shipped out on a truck
at the crack of dawn. Must be nice.

0:54:01.783 --> 0:54:04.123
What? No! No, my parents
are back in quarantine?

0:54:04.286 --> 0:54:07.036
They're being shipped to Cleveland?
But I just got here!

0:54:07.206 --> 0:54:08.866
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.

0:54:09.041 --> 0:54:11.501
Don't worry,
it's easy to get to quarantine.

0:54:11.668 --> 0:54:13.338
You can just go through the pipes,
honey.

0:54:15.672 --> 0:54:18.262
Oh. Oh I can't do that.

0:54:18.967 --> 0:54:21.467
-Why not?
-I'll forget where I'm going.

0:54:21.637 --> 0:54:24.807
And I can't be somewhere
where I have nobody to help me.

0:54:24.973 --> 0:54:27.853
-Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
-You're not helping, bill.

0:54:28.018 --> 0:54:30.518
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.

0:54:34.441 --> 0:54:35.651
Oh boy.

0:54:36.235 --> 0:54:40.165
Could you tell me how to get there?
Through the pipes?

0:54:40.322 --> 0:54:44.332
Sure, honey. It's two lefts
and then a right. Simple.

0:54:48.330 --> 0:54:49.870
Okay.

0:54:52.042 --> 0:54:54.712
Two lefts and a right. I can do this.

0:54:54.878 --> 0:54:57.708
Two lefts and a right. Okay.
Don't forget.

0:55:03.554 --> 0:55:05.604
Two lefts and a right.
Two lefts and a right.

0:55:06.598 --> 0:55:10.558
Two lefts and a right. Two lefts
and a right. Two lefts and a right.

0:55:12.437 --> 0:55:16.397
Two lefts and a right? Shoot.

0:55:17.609 --> 0:55:21.529
Left and a right. Wait.
Did I already take a left?

0:55:21.655 --> 0:55:26.035
Oh no. It's happening. Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

0:55:26.159 --> 0:55:30.079
Which way? Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.

0:55:30.247 --> 0:55:31.827
Okay. I'm lost. It's too hard.
I can't remember.

0:55:31.915 --> 0:55:33.075
I'm forgetting everything.

0:55:33.250 --> 0:55:37.090
I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes! The pipe pals.

0:55:37.212 --> 0:55:39.762
Pipe pals? Pipe pals!

0:55:39.923 --> 0:55:43.473
-And...Swim, swim, swim.
-Yeah, I don't know about this.

0:55:43.635 --> 0:55:46.045
Trust me,
i won't let you hit anything. Wall!

0:55:46.930 --> 0:55:49.140
What's the point?
I'll never learn to get around!

0:55:49.224 --> 0:55:51.984
You better! If you can't do it in here
you'll never do it out in the ocean.

0:55:52.060 --> 0:55:54.310
Now really focus, okay? Wall!

0:55:54.479 --> 0:55:55.979
Destiny!

0:55:56.148 --> 0:55:57.938
Dory? Hello?

0:55:58.108 --> 0:56:01.818
I'm lost in the pipes
and my parents are in quarantine!

0:56:01.987 --> 0:56:05.317
Hang on, dory! Bailey!
You've got to use your echolocation!

0:56:05.490 --> 0:56:06.320
You know it's broken!

0:56:06.491 --> 0:56:08.991
Just stop it, and try the "ooh" thing
dory talked about, will you?

0:56:09.077 --> 0:56:11.117
-But I don't think I can--
-don't bail on me, Bailey!

0:56:12.206 --> 0:56:15.166
Ooh!

0:56:16.418 --> 0:56:17.628
Ooh! Ooh!

0:56:17.794 --> 0:56:20.804
Come on, Bailey. What did you
just tell me, huh? Really focus!

0:56:20.964 --> 0:56:22.344
Ooh! I feel stupid.

0:56:22.508 --> 0:56:24.628
-Bailey.
-Sorry. Ooh!

0:56:24.801 --> 0:56:28.301
-Hello?
-Here! We're here!

0:56:28.472 --> 0:56:32.142
-Guys-- ooh! Guys-- ooh!
-What? What is it?

0:56:32.184 --> 0:56:36.404
I'm getting something! Ooh!
Here we go! Ooh! Oh yes! Ooh!

0:56:37.022 --> 0:56:41.152
I can see the quarantine!
This is amazing!

0:56:41.276 --> 0:56:45.276
Ooh! I can see everything!
And I can see you!

0:56:45.322 --> 0:56:47.122
He can see you!

0:56:47.282 --> 0:56:51.372
My life's a rainbow! Can you see me?
Right, it doesn't work that way.

0:56:51.537 --> 0:56:53.657
-Bailey!
-Okay! Tell dory to go left!

0:56:53.830 --> 0:56:55.210
He says go left!

0:56:55.374 --> 0:56:56.794
Left?

0:56:58.377 --> 0:57:00.377
-Ooh! Straight!
-Straight!

0:57:00.462 --> 0:57:01.342
-Straight!
-Ooh! Go right!

0:57:02.673 --> 0:57:04.343
-Right!
-Right!

0:57:05.175 --> 0:57:08.215
Ooh! I'm light-headed! Ooh! Wait. Ooh!

0:57:08.387 --> 0:57:10.677
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on! Let me zoom out.

0:57:12.516 --> 0:57:14.676
Holy Neptune, she's not alone! Ooh!

0:57:14.726 --> 0:57:16.806
-What is it?
-I can't tell! But it's coming for her.

0:57:16.937 --> 0:57:20.517
Oh no! Dory, swim! Swim the other way!

0:57:20.691 --> 0:57:22.111
-What? Where?
-What? Where?

0:57:22.234 --> 0:57:23.784
-Go right!
-Right!

0:57:25.779 --> 0:57:28.199
No, my right! Oh no!
She's heading right towards it!

0:57:28.365 --> 0:57:30.195
No! Dory, turn around!

0:57:32.035 --> 0:57:34.535
That's great, dory!
You're headed right toward us!

0:57:34.705 --> 0:57:36.375
What? You want me to go right?

0:57:36.498 --> 0:57:37.958
No! No! Not right. Oh, I can't look!

0:57:42.212 --> 0:57:43.712
-Dory!
-Marlin?

0:57:43.839 --> 0:57:45.219
-I knew it! You're okay!
-Oh my gosh!

0:57:45.382 --> 0:57:49.222
It's consuming her! It's eating her alive!

0:57:50.888 --> 0:57:53.388
-You're okay!
-You found me! How did you find me?

0:57:53.557 --> 0:57:55.727
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.

0:57:55.893 --> 0:57:59.063
We just slowly backed away from him
and into these pipes.

0:57:59.229 --> 0:58:00.729
And then we just started looking.

0:58:00.898 --> 0:58:03.568
Dory! I'm sorry!

0:58:03.734 --> 0:58:05.244
Okay, what was that?

0:58:05.402 --> 0:58:06.742
Hang on. I got to take this.

0:58:06.904 --> 0:58:09.614
It's okay! Sorry for what?

0:58:09.740 --> 0:58:11.740
What? You're okay?

0:58:11.909 --> 0:58:13.909
-Yes!
-I found marlin and Nemo!

0:58:14.578 --> 0:58:17.288
Dad! Did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.

0:58:17.456 --> 0:58:18.576
I heard.

0:58:18.624 --> 0:58:21.214
It's bringing back some very bad
memories so let's get out of here.

0:58:21.376 --> 0:58:25.206
I say we go this way. Follow me.
It's time to head home!

0:58:25.756 --> 0:58:29.176
Wait, wait, wait! My parents are here.

0:58:29.301 --> 0:58:31.091
-They are?
-You found your parents?

0:58:31.261 --> 0:58:35.601
Well, not exactly. No. I mean not yet,
but I know where they are.

0:58:35.766 --> 0:58:40.056
I don't know exactly how to get there,
but I know that-- I'm getting help--

0:58:40.229 --> 0:58:41.939
-down to quarantine.
-Quarantine.

0:58:42.105 --> 0:58:45.775
That's it! Oh, and I met
this septopus, super cranky...

0:58:45.943 --> 0:58:50.953
But secretly kind of sweet, and he
got me into the exhibit... the exhibit.

0:58:53.450 --> 0:58:54.450
Dory?

0:58:55.285 --> 0:58:57.445
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?

0:58:57.621 --> 0:58:59.961
What?
Why wouldn't they want to see you?

0:59:00.791 --> 0:59:03.961
Because... I lost them?

0:59:04.962 --> 0:59:08.922
Dory, your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.

0:59:09.758 --> 0:59:12.798
They're going to have missed...
Everything about you.

0:59:12.970 --> 0:59:15.310
-Really?
-Do you know how we found you?

0:59:15.472 --> 0:59:17.312
-Something about a clam? Or...
-No.

0:59:17.474 --> 0:59:18.314
-No, an oyster.
-No.

0:59:18.475 --> 0:59:19.515
-Mollusk?
-No.

0:59:19.685 --> 0:59:20.355
-Something?
-No.

0:59:20.519 --> 0:59:21.769
-I don't... no?
-No clam.

0:59:21.937 --> 0:59:24.647
We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...

0:59:24.815 --> 0:59:26.825
"What would dory do?"

0:59:27.401 --> 0:59:28.651
Why would you say that?

0:59:28.819 --> 0:59:31.819
Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...

0:59:31.989 --> 0:59:36.199
Stuff I never dreamed of doing.
Crazy things!

0:59:37.035 --> 0:59:40.535
Outsmarting sharks
and jumping jellyfish.

0:59:41.707 --> 0:59:45.997
And finding my son.
You made all that happen.

0:59:47.212 --> 0:59:52.052
Really? I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.

0:59:53.302 --> 0:59:56.512
No, you didn't forget. I never told you.

0:59:57.848 --> 0:59:59.518
And I'm sorry about that.

1:00:01.810 --> 1:00:07.650
But, dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.

1:00:09.651 --> 1:00:15.201
And when you do that, you'll be home.

1:00:27.711 --> 1:00:29.211
Dad.

1:00:29.379 --> 1:00:32.419
Does this mean
we have to say goodbye to dory?

1:00:34.343 --> 1:00:36.393
Yes, Nemo. We do.

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:54.150
Marine life
institute

1:00:56.448 --> 1:00:58.408
hey, so how much more
we got left to load?

1:00:58.575 --> 1:01:00.075
Just this last row.

1:01:00.244 --> 1:01:02.624
The sooner we finish,
the sooner this truck gets to Cleveland.

1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:05.370
-Watch the turn.
-Watch what? Ow!

1:01:05.541 --> 1:01:08.421
-Too late.
-Okay, I think we're close. Whee!

1:01:10.170 --> 1:01:11.710
Hi!

1:01:11.839 --> 1:01:14.919
-Is this quarantine?
-Yes! This is it! We're in quarantine!

1:01:15.092 --> 1:01:16.432
My parents are here!

1:01:17.594 --> 1:01:20.104
Where are we going? Hey, what--
no, why are we going towards the door?

1:01:20.264 --> 1:01:24.274
-We are all better!
-I feel fantastic!

1:01:25.936 --> 1:01:26.896
Dude.

1:01:29.106 --> 1:01:32.316
My family! Come on, let's go!
Excuse me.

1:01:32.401 --> 1:01:33.571
Dory, wait a minute!

1:01:37.155 --> 1:01:40.775
I'm coming mommy! I'm coming daddy!

1:01:41.743 --> 1:01:44.793
Whoo-hoo! Almost home.
Almost home. I'm almost home.

1:01:44.913 --> 1:01:47.583
I think I'm getting the hang of this! Oh!

1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:52.880
I hear footsteps.

1:01:55.966 --> 1:01:57.006
-Hank!
-Quiet.

1:01:57.259 --> 1:01:59.639
Hank, we need to get in that tank.
That rhymed.

1:01:59.803 --> 1:02:01.643
-Why?
-Her parents are there!

1:02:03.182 --> 1:02:07.142
Look, you've got three minutes
to get everyone in this cup with you...

1:02:07.311 --> 1:02:09.151
And then I'm on that truck
to Cleveland, got it?

1:02:09.313 --> 1:02:10.193
Got it.

1:02:14.693 --> 1:02:15.943
Oh boy.

1:02:20.407 --> 1:02:22.117
Mom? Dad?

1:02:22.284 --> 1:02:26.624
Mom? Dad?
Hey, everybody. It's me, dory!

1:02:26.788 --> 1:02:30.328
Dory? Dory? Dory?
Jenny and Charlie's dory? Dory?

1:02:30.459 --> 1:02:32.169
Mom? Dad?

1:02:33.003 --> 1:02:34.503
Mom? Dad?

1:02:35.839 --> 1:02:37.799
Mom? Dad?

1:02:38.717 --> 1:02:41.337
-She should just pick 2 and let's go.
-Dad.

1:02:41.512 --> 1:02:43.932
What? I'm kidding. It's a reunion.

1:02:44.056 --> 1:02:47.846
Mom? Dad? Where are my parents?

1:02:48.852 --> 1:02:51.942
Dory? Are you really
Jenny and Charlie's girl?

1:02:52.064 --> 1:02:55.034
Yes, I am! That's me! Where are they?

1:02:55.150 --> 1:02:58.360
Dory, right after you disappeared,
they thought you...

1:02:58.529 --> 1:03:01.869
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.

1:03:01.949 --> 1:03:04.869
-Uh-huh?
-Come on, come on, come on.

1:03:04.993 --> 1:03:08.543
And so they came here to look for you.

1:03:08.705 --> 1:03:10.365
They're here! Where are they?

1:03:12.668 --> 1:03:16.208
Dory, that was years ago.

1:03:16.380 --> 1:03:19.220
-Huh?
-They never came back.

1:03:19.341 --> 1:03:20.471
Oh no.

1:03:20.592 --> 1:03:24.972
You see, dory, when fish
don't come back from quarantine...

1:03:25.097 --> 1:03:27.307
It means they're not...

1:03:28.016 --> 1:03:28.926
What?

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:31.770
Dory, they're gone.

1:03:32.521 --> 1:03:34.231
They're dead?

1:03:34.982 --> 1:03:38.572
-They wanted to find you...
-Wait. Are you sure they're gone?

1:03:39.403 --> 1:03:41.533
Dory, listen, it's going to be okay.

1:03:41.697 --> 1:03:43.067
Dory, they loved you so much.

1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:46.080
Anyone not looking to go to Cleveland,
final warning!

1:03:48.787 --> 1:03:51.617
-Dory, are you all right?
-Are you okay?

1:03:51.748 --> 1:03:54.918
-I was too late.
-Dory, no. No. Now listen.

1:03:55.085 --> 1:03:58.915
-I don't have a family.
-No, dory. That's not true.

1:03:59.590 --> 1:04:01.800
Time to go!

1:04:01.967 --> 1:04:03.797
I'm all alone.

1:04:03.969 --> 1:04:05.469
-Dory.
-Dory!

1:04:07.723 --> 1:04:09.143
Where's everybody else?

1:04:10.100 --> 1:04:12.600
Your orange friends are on their way
to Cleveland. Ah!

1:04:12.769 --> 1:04:14.099
I found the octopus!

1:04:15.731 --> 1:04:16.941
Where did he go?

1:04:25.782 --> 1:04:27.912
Mommy? Daddy?

1:04:34.458 --> 1:04:35.458
Help.

1:04:37.294 --> 1:04:41.804
No. No. No. Help. Help. Help me.

1:04:41.965 --> 1:04:47.295
Help. Help me. Please.
Somebody help me!

1:04:48.639 --> 1:04:51.019
Hey, can-- help me?
Can you help me? I've lost them!

1:04:51.183 --> 1:04:54.523
-Oh. Lost who?
-I-i-i-i...

1:04:54.686 --> 1:04:57.516
Ah, sorry, honey. I can't help you
if you don't remember.

1:05:00.943 --> 1:05:04.033
Oh! Can you help me? I've lost...Them.

1:05:04.196 --> 1:05:05.526
Can you be more specific?

1:05:05.697 --> 1:05:07.947
My-- my-- them! Them! Them!

1:05:14.498 --> 1:05:16.828
Help! Help!

1:05:18.335 --> 1:05:20.955
Please? They're gone!

1:05:35.310 --> 1:05:40.150
I've lost... I've lost everyone.
There's nothing I can do.

1:05:42.234 --> 1:05:46.534
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting? Something.

1:05:47.865 --> 1:05:50.415
Something important. What was it? I--

1:05:52.202 --> 1:05:55.542
what was it? It's going away.

1:05:56.373 --> 1:06:00.383
It's going away. It's going because
all I can do is forget. I just forget.

1:06:00.544 --> 1:06:04.674
And I forget. That's what I do best.
That's what I do.

1:06:06.008 --> 1:06:10.548
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

1:06:12.556 --> 1:06:14.216
What would dory do?

1:06:16.894 --> 1:06:18.734
I would look around.

1:06:21.231 --> 1:06:25.071
And there's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.

1:06:26.069 --> 1:06:27.739
Kelp is better. Okay.

1:06:33.452 --> 1:06:38.042
Okay. Now what? Lots of kelp.
It looks the same.

1:06:39.374 --> 1:06:43.754
It all looks the same,
except there's a rock...Over there.

1:06:44.421 --> 1:06:49.381
And some sand this way.
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

1:07:05.108 --> 1:07:06.608
Oh this isn't going anywhere.

1:07:08.737 --> 1:07:13.827
There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp. Lots of kelp.

1:07:13.992 --> 1:07:18.122
And some shells...This way.

1:07:19.456 --> 1:07:20.786
I like shells.

1:07:24.336 --> 1:07:27.756
I like...Shells.

1:07:54.116 --> 1:07:55.446
Whoa.

1:08:32.905 --> 1:08:34.495
Hello. I'm--

1:08:34.615 --> 1:08:37.915
-dory!
-Dory! You're here.

1:08:38.076 --> 1:08:39.826
-Oh my baby!
-You're really here.

1:08:39.995 --> 1:08:41.045
-Let me look at you.
-You found us.

1:08:41.205 --> 1:08:43.375
-I'm never letting you go again.
-Oh my missing girl, you're here.

1:08:43.498 --> 1:08:44.538
-My baby!
-It's you.

1:08:44.708 --> 1:08:48.378
-Yes! Oh absolutely!
-It's really you! Mom, you're here.

1:08:48.545 --> 1:08:51.205
-I am, I...
-And dad, so are you.

1:08:51.298 --> 1:08:52.838
Right here, kelpcake.

1:08:56.386 --> 1:08:58.046
I'm so sorry.

1:08:58.222 --> 1:09:00.892
Oh honey. Oh honey, no. Kelpcake.

1:09:01.058 --> 1:09:04.728
I know I've got a problem. I know I'm--
and I'm so sorry.

1:09:04.895 --> 1:09:09.025
And all this time I've wanted to fix it
and I can't and I try. I try.

1:09:09.066 --> 1:09:11.896
But my thoughts --they leave my head
and ideas change.

1:09:12.069 --> 1:09:14.199
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.

1:09:14.363 --> 1:09:19.413
Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.
Look what you did.

1:09:20.077 --> 1:09:23.247
-What?
-You found us!

1:09:23.413 --> 1:09:25.173
That's right. You found us.

1:09:26.667 --> 1:09:30.127
Honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?

1:09:30.295 --> 1:09:34.125
Because we believed one day
you'd find us again.

1:09:34.258 --> 1:09:35.428
Exactly!

1:09:36.134 --> 1:09:39.104
But I thought you were gone.
How did you--

1:09:39.179 --> 1:09:42.219
we went into quarantine to look for you,
but you weren't there.

1:09:42.391 --> 1:09:45.391
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

1:09:45.561 --> 1:09:47.771
Through the pipes.
That's right, sweetie. And so we did too.

1:09:47.938 --> 1:09:51.778
And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.

1:09:51.942 --> 1:09:54.282
-We thought you might come back.
-We stayed and waited for you.

1:09:54.444 --> 1:09:57.454
So every day, we go out and lay out...

1:09:58.407 --> 1:09:59.487
Shells.

1:10:04.955 --> 1:10:09.795
And you found us.
Oh honey, you found us.

1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:12.460
And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.

1:10:14.006 --> 1:10:18.926
You remembered
in your own, amazing, dory way.

1:10:21.430 --> 1:10:24.310
I did. All by myself.

1:10:24.474 --> 1:10:29.984
Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?

1:10:30.147 --> 1:10:31.817
Oh, my poor little girl.

1:10:31.982 --> 1:10:35.822
Oh, I haven't been all by myself--
marlin and Nemo!

1:10:36.778 --> 1:10:38.948
-Nobody saw where dory went?
-No. Sorry. I didn't see anything.

1:10:39.114 --> 1:10:42.034
Seriously?
That's a lot of eyeballs doing nothing.

1:10:42.284 --> 1:10:43.874
Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

1:10:44.036 --> 1:10:45.536
-We're looking--
-me help you?

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:51.173
Dad, look! It's dory.

1:10:51.293 --> 1:10:55.763
Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
i knew she'd find a way-- what?

1:10:55.881 --> 1:10:57.341
Hey, where's dory? Is she with you?

1:10:58.175 --> 1:11:02.515
I'm sorry. I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.

1:11:02.638 --> 1:11:04.598
-What?
-All right. Let's get going.

1:11:04.723 --> 1:11:05.893
No!

1:11:06.016 --> 1:11:08.556
And then the whale swallowed us
even though I speak whale.

1:11:08.727 --> 1:11:10.347
-A whale?
-Good thing I wasn't there to see that.

1:11:10.521 --> 1:11:12.811
Actually marlin never believes
i even know how to speak whale...

1:11:12.981 --> 1:11:14.861
But you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

1:11:15.025 --> 1:11:16.525
You know, I like this marlin already.

1:11:16.693 --> 1:11:19.153
Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?

1:11:19.321 --> 1:11:21.741
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

1:11:21.907 --> 1:11:23.617
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:24.870
What would dory do?

1:11:25.035 --> 1:11:27.825
Well, we'll certainly have to thank
marlin and Nemo when we meet them.

1:11:29.373 --> 1:11:31.543
Wait. Wait I know this place.

1:11:31.750 --> 1:11:34.750
Hello. I'm sigourney Weaver.

1:11:34.878 --> 1:11:37.548
-There!
-Won't you please join us?

1:11:37.589 --> 1:11:40.719
-That's the marine life institute.
-Oh, you were born there.

1:11:40.884 --> 1:11:41.724
Dory, is that where your friends are?

1:11:41.885 --> 1:11:45.925
Yes! They were stuck in something.
It was going somewhere.

1:11:46.890 --> 1:11:48.980
A truck. They're in the truck!

1:11:49.059 --> 1:11:51.059
That means I could--
never see them again!

1:11:51.228 --> 1:11:53.268
No! No, no, no. What would dory do?

1:11:54.231 --> 1:11:58.401
I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.

1:11:59.486 --> 1:12:01.736
Please! Please.
All I know is that I miss them. I-- I...

1:12:01.905 --> 1:12:06.735
I really miss them. I've said that before.

1:12:09.371 --> 1:12:10.411
Dory?

1:12:10.539 --> 1:12:15.249
Mom, marlin and Nemo are more
than good friends, they're family.

1:12:15.419 --> 1:12:19.299
And I have to get them back.
See, when they found me it felt like fate.

1:12:19.423 --> 1:12:22.093
Do you know what I mean? Or... I don't--
what's another word for fate?

1:12:22.259 --> 1:12:27.259
Like destiny. Destiny? Destiny!

1:12:27.639 --> 1:12:29.559
-Dory?
-Destiny!

1:12:29.725 --> 1:12:32.985
-Morning, dest--
-sh. It's dory. Something's wrong.

1:12:34.771 --> 1:12:38.111
Ooh. I got her.
She's right outside the institute.

1:12:39.902 --> 1:12:41.072
-Destiny?
-We got to jump.

1:12:41.236 --> 1:12:42.816
-Jump?
-No time to argue!

1:12:42.946 --> 1:12:44.446
Destiny!

1:12:44.573 --> 1:12:47.453
Dory! The truck thing
with your friends is leaving!

1:12:47.618 --> 1:12:51.748
-No, no. Destiny.
-Oh no! That's bad! What do we do?

1:12:54.208 --> 1:12:56.078
-All right.
-Yes.

1:12:56.126 --> 1:12:57.996
-Here we go. One. Two.
-Yes. Yes.

1:12:58.086 --> 1:12:59.956
I can't! I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there.

1:13:00.214 --> 1:13:03.634
Destiny! I've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:05.470
You've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

1:13:05.636 --> 1:13:06.966
I will be your eyes.

1:13:07.137 --> 1:13:09.467
You can be my eyes. But the walls!

1:13:09.598 --> 1:13:11.678
There are no walls in the ocean!

1:13:12.309 --> 1:13:15.439
-No walls?
-It's your destiny, destiny.

1:13:15.562 --> 1:13:17.612
Well, why didn't you say so?

1:13:17.773 --> 1:13:21.153
What? No! Destiny, wait!
No, that's a wall! Wall!

1:13:26.490 --> 1:13:29.200
Mom, dad, this is my pipe pal.
Destiny, say hi.

1:13:29.368 --> 1:13:31.288
Dory! Are these little blue blobs
your parents?

1:13:31.328 --> 1:13:32.698
They look just like you!

1:13:33.372 --> 1:13:36.002
Hello. I'm Bailey. Mrs. dory, Mr. dory.

1:13:36.166 --> 1:13:37.536
-Oh please, call me Jenny.
-Oh and I'm Charlie.

1:13:37.709 --> 1:13:39.539
Okay. Okay. We got to go.
We got to stop that truck.

1:13:40.170 --> 1:13:41.050
Okay, what truck?

1:13:43.841 --> 1:13:45.181
Bailey, status report.

1:13:45.342 --> 1:13:48.512
Oh, yes, my beautiful gift. Ooh.

1:13:48.679 --> 1:13:50.849
Found it! The truck's merging
onto the freeway

1:13:50.931 --> 1:13:52.351
and it's heading south. Ooh.

1:13:52.516 --> 1:13:54.806
Let's go. We are stopping that truck.

1:13:56.228 --> 1:13:58.978
-This I've got to see.
-Yeah, yeah, me too!

1:13:59.690 --> 1:14:01.320
Oh boy, this is gonna be good!

1:14:02.192 --> 1:14:04.282
What the-- Gerald!
Have you lost your marbles?

1:14:04.820 --> 1:14:07.320
-Don't get used to it, Gerald!
-Cheeky joke.

1:14:10.534 --> 1:14:12.414
Bailey, I forgot everything.
Catch me up.

1:14:12.578 --> 1:14:15.538
Yes, ma'am. Ooh.
Your friends are still on the truck.

1:14:15.706 --> 1:14:18.246
Ooh. They're headed north
towards the bridge. Ooh.

1:14:18.417 --> 1:14:22.337
Oh, look, there's a bunch of cute otters
over there. I want one! Ow!

1:14:25.632 --> 1:14:27.092
Ow, Bailey!

1:14:27.176 --> 1:14:29.256
Oh! I see the truck. It's over there.

1:14:29.428 --> 1:14:31.098
-Okay, what would dory do?
-I don't see how we can get on it.

1:14:31.263 --> 1:14:33.263
Oh, man, if only there was a way
to stop traffic.

1:14:33.432 --> 1:14:36.022
Stop traffic. Stop traffic!
Everyone needs to stop.

1:14:36.185 --> 1:14:38.355
People stop to look at things. Things
that they like. Things that are cute.

1:14:38.854 --> 1:14:41.864
Things that are cute! Okay, I got it.

1:14:41.899 --> 1:14:43.609
-What? What is it?
-Quickly before I forget.

1:14:43.775 --> 1:14:46.395
Destiny, when the truck reaches
the bridge you flip me up there.

1:14:46.570 --> 1:14:47.150
Got it.

1:14:47.279 --> 1:14:50.069
You guys, follow me.
Everyone else, stay here.

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:53.790
Whoa. Dory.
Honey, you're not leaving us again.

1:14:53.952 --> 1:14:55.622
Your mother's right.
You have to stay with us.

1:14:55.787 --> 1:14:59.617
Dory, what happens if--
you know, if you're gone for too long.

1:14:59.791 --> 1:15:02.501
And what if you get confused and that
makes you distracted. And what if--

1:15:02.628 --> 1:15:03.918
I lose you again?

1:15:05.297 --> 1:15:06.547
Yes.

1:15:08.008 --> 1:15:10.798
Mom, dad,
it's gonna be okay because...

1:15:10.969 --> 1:15:14.759
I know that even if I forget
i can find you again.

1:15:19.311 --> 1:15:22.811
Ooh. Okay a little left. Ooh.
Back the other way a bit.

1:15:22.981 --> 1:15:25.111
Ooh. Okay, that's it. Go! Don't do it.

1:15:25.275 --> 1:15:27.435
-Bailey!
-Okay, now! Now! Do it! Do it!

1:15:27.569 --> 1:15:29.279
-Time for your idea.
-Okay. What idea?

1:15:37.079 --> 1:15:40.419
Okay. What do I do?
What would dory do?

1:15:40.541 --> 1:15:42.921
Come on, cars, cars. I see cars.
Otters in front of cars.

1:15:43.043 --> 1:15:45.963
Cars have to stop.
Stop traffic! Cuddle party!

1:15:48.590 --> 1:15:49.590
Look out!

1:15:51.593 --> 1:15:53.183
They're so cute!

1:15:53.303 --> 1:15:56.223
Look at them! There must be one, two…

1:15:59.643 --> 1:16:02.103
-what's going on, dad?
-I don't know how.

1:16:02.271 --> 1:16:05.151
I don't know in what way, but I think
this has something to do with--

1:16:07.901 --> 1:16:11.651
-dory!
-Water. Water. I need water.

1:16:11.822 --> 1:16:12.952
Are you crazy? How'd you get here?

1:16:14.449 --> 1:16:16.119
-Dory!
-Oh!

1:16:16.243 --> 1:16:19.003
-I thought we'd never see you again.
-Aw, me too.

1:16:19.162 --> 1:16:22.252
But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried
i just couldn't forget you.

1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:25.920
I guess I missed the rest of my family
too much, huh?

1:16:26.044 --> 1:16:27.754
-We're family?
-Mm-hmm.

1:16:28.839 --> 1:16:30.339
Do you know what that feels like?

1:16:31.633 --> 1:16:33.843
Yes, I know what that feels like.

1:16:34.845 --> 1:16:36.355
Aw!

1:16:36.513 --> 1:16:39.853
Hey! Hey, come on. Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo!

1:16:40.017 --> 1:16:42.557
-Oh no. There goes our ride.
-Back in the water. Come on.

1:16:42.686 --> 1:16:45.686
Dory, the traffic is starting to move.

1:16:46.315 --> 1:16:50.495
Leave it to me. I got this.
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

1:16:50.527 --> 1:16:53.817
Becky! Becky, come back.
We need your help! Becky!

1:16:55.741 --> 1:16:56.911
Dory, follow me.

1:16:58.243 --> 1:17:01.583
No, no, wait. We don't have dory!
No, no, Becky wait! Stop it.

1:17:01.747 --> 1:17:06.537
We need to go back. Becky, back!
Back, Becky! Loo-loo. Ooo-roo-roo.

1:17:07.211 --> 1:17:08.881
-Please don't eat us!
-Where's dory?

1:17:09.046 --> 1:17:10.666
-Who are you?
-Jenny?

1:17:10.797 --> 1:17:12.007
-Marlin?
-Charlie?

1:17:12.090 --> 1:17:16.010
-Nemo? Thank you so much.
-Thank you for taking care of dory.

1:17:16.178 --> 1:17:18.098
Dory! She's still in the truck.

1:17:18.263 --> 1:17:22.063
Becky! Fetch dory! Ooo-roo. Dor-roo.

1:17:25.521 --> 1:17:27.731
Okay, kid. I guess this is goodbye.

1:17:27.856 --> 1:17:29.066
-No!
-What do you mean, "no"?

1:17:29.233 --> 1:17:31.743
You're not going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to the ocean with me.

1:17:31.777 --> 1:17:33.397
What is it with you
and ruining my plans?

1:17:33.487 --> 1:17:36.567
Listen to me, I have one goal in life.
One! And it is to--

1:17:36.740 --> 1:17:40.410
no, you listen to me. What is so great
about plans? I never had a plan.

1:17:40.452 --> 1:17:44.042
Did I plan to lose my parents? No.
Did I plan to find marlin? No.

1:17:44.206 --> 1:17:46.826
Did you and I plan to meet?
Wait. Did we?

1:17:46.959 --> 1:17:49.129
-Are you almost done?
-Well, I don't think we did.

1:17:49.253 --> 1:17:52.093
And that's because the best things
happen by chance. Because that's life.

1:17:52.256 --> 1:17:56.796
That's you being with me out
in the ocean not safe in some glass box.

1:17:56.969 --> 1:17:57.969
-Can I say something?
-I'm not done!

1:17:58.095 --> 1:18:01.265
A friend of mine-- her name's
sigourney-- once told me that...

1:18:01.431 --> 1:18:02.931
All it takes is three simple steps:

1:18:03.100 --> 1:18:06.480
Rescue, rehabilitation,
and one other thing--

1:18:06.645 --> 1:18:07.735
release!

1:18:08.772 --> 1:18:10.942
That's right! So what do you say?

1:18:11.108 --> 1:18:14.068
Release! Release! Release!

1:18:14.236 --> 1:18:17.526
Release! Release! Release!

1:18:17.656 --> 1:18:20.236
Release! Release! Release!

1:18:20.284 --> 1:18:21.794
I was gonna say, "okay."

1:18:24.162 --> 1:18:25.462
Not good.

1:18:25.789 --> 1:18:27.789
-Oh no! They're going away!
-Oh no! Dory! What do we do?

1:18:27.916 --> 1:18:29.456
Quick! Guys, grab my fin!

1:18:31.587 --> 1:18:35.337
Ooh! He's trying to get the door open.
Ooh. It's locked from the outside.

1:18:35.424 --> 1:18:36.634
Come on, dory. You can do it.

1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:39.140
Destiny! Destiny! Wall! Wall! Wall!

1:18:40.470 --> 1:18:43.010
-Dory, no! Wait!
-Dory!

1:18:43.682 --> 1:18:47.192
-Bailey, where are they headed?
-Ooh. I'm losing them.

1:18:51.607 --> 1:18:53.567
Dory, it's over.

1:18:53.817 --> 1:18:56.817
-No, there's got to be a way.
-Yeah. There's a way!

1:18:56.987 --> 1:18:59.607
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.

1:18:59.781 --> 1:19:02.121
But-- there's got to be a way.
There's always a way.

1:19:02.701 --> 1:19:05.831
There isn't, dory. I'm telling you.
This time there is no other way.

1:19:06.038 --> 1:19:07.408
Well, what about that?

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:11.498
Holy carp. There is another way.

1:19:12.544 --> 1:19:14.094
Take a deep breath, kid.

1:19:14.213 --> 1:19:16.513
Release! Release! Release!

1:19:16.673 --> 1:19:20.683
Release! Release! Release! Release!

1:19:25.849 --> 1:19:28.889
-What is that?
-I don’t care what it is! Get it off!

1:19:29.019 --> 1:19:30.439
What the--

1:19:30.896 --> 1:19:32.356
suck it, bipeds.

1:19:33.524 --> 1:19:36.784
All right, Hank, you've got seven arms--
i don't know. Just try something.

1:19:36.902 --> 1:19:38.152
Okay. Here we go.

1:19:39.988 --> 1:19:43.528
-Huh? Hey! Stop. Stop. Wait! No!
-Hey! Hey! Stop. Wait. Oh no!

1:19:43.617 --> 1:19:46.367
-That's doing something.
-And we are moving. Good job, Hank.

1:19:46.495 --> 1:19:51.465
-Wait, wait, wait! Come on! Whoa!
-Hey! What? Hey! Stop! Wait. Wait.

1:19:51.583 --> 1:19:54.883
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
how to drive. Certainly I can't do--

1:19:55.045 --> 1:19:56.705
I'm not in any position--
but could you go faster?

1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:59.880
No! No, no! No, no, no!

1:20:02.344 --> 1:20:04.514
-Whoo!
-Hey! Give us our truck back!

1:20:04.638 --> 1:20:06.218
I can't see squat.
Which way are we going?

1:20:06.390 --> 1:20:10.310
Okay. Well, all the cars
are going left so go left.

1:20:10.435 --> 1:20:13.895
Gilman street. Ashby Avenue. Powell.

1:20:13.939 --> 1:20:16.519
Gilman street again. Huh.
Gilman street again.

1:20:16.567 --> 1:20:18.527
How much longer
are we gonna veer left?

1:20:21.405 --> 1:20:23.955
Okay, we just need to know
how we got on,

1:20:24.032 --> 1:20:25.372
then we'll know how to get off.

1:20:25.492 --> 1:20:27.042
Well, let me know
when you figure it out.

1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:28.750
Unfortunately I can't remember
how we got on.

1:20:28.912 --> 1:20:31.252
Hey, I know those guys!
That's where we came from. Turn right.

1:20:31.331 --> 1:20:32.831
Here we go!

1:20:37.713 --> 1:20:42.093
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait!
-Oh my-- whoa. Hey!

1:20:42.593 --> 1:20:44.723
We are so fired.

1:20:44.970 --> 1:20:49.350
Keep straight. Straight. Left. Left.
No, no, no. Right. Right. Right.

1:20:50.434 --> 1:20:52.524
-Good driving, Hank.
-Pay attention to the road.

1:20:52.644 --> 1:20:54.904
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. Uh-oh.
Fork in the road.

1:20:55.022 --> 1:20:57.402
-Which way?
-Ocean. Ocean. Hey, a boat!

1:20:57.524 --> 1:20:59.364
You know, I haven't had
great experiences with boats, but i--

1:20:59.484 --> 1:21:02.954
-which way?
-Boats go to the ocean. Right!

1:21:02.988 --> 1:21:04.278
Hold on!

1:21:07.534 --> 1:21:08.704
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?

1:21:08.827 --> 1:21:11.957
Okay, I'll figure it out.
I don't know, but--

1:21:12.039 --> 1:21:13.289
well, something will come and--

1:21:14.791 --> 1:21:18.841
seagulls. Hank, follow those birds!
The ocean's left, Hank.

1:21:20.047 --> 1:21:22.257
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

1:21:22.299 --> 1:21:25.219
Ooh. Hold on. Ooh.
I'm getting something.

1:21:25.302 --> 1:21:26.642
Is it them? Is everything perfect?

1:21:26.803 --> 1:21:30.313
Uh-oh, it's the fuzz. Busted.

1:21:33.852 --> 1:21:37.312
Okay, we're good. The ocean!
It's straight ahead. Floor it!

1:21:37.481 --> 1:21:38.441
Now we're talking.

1:21:40.150 --> 1:21:43.150
-Oh. Uh-oh!
-What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

1:21:43.237 --> 1:21:45.697
Oh no. What would I do?
What would I do? What would I do?

1:21:46.698 --> 1:21:49.078
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.

1:21:49.201 --> 1:21:50.871
I'm okay with crazy.

1:21:51.578 --> 1:21:52.788
All right, Hank.

1:21:52.913 --> 1:21:56.963
Ooh. There's no way out. It's over.
They're going to fish jail! Ooh!

1:21:57.125 --> 1:22:02.125
Wait. Ooh. Oh no. Ooh.
Get back! Incoming!

1:22:34.663 --> 1:22:37.713
Fish!

1:22:44.131 --> 1:22:48.391
What lies before you represents
the third and final part of the...

1:22:48.719 --> 1:22:50.349
Marine life mission.

1:22:50.512 --> 1:22:55.682
Rescue, rehabilitation, and release.

1:22:56.435 --> 1:22:58.235
Come to papa.

1:23:03.859 --> 1:23:07.069
I'm sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.

1:23:10.073 --> 1:23:13.873
One, two, three, four...

1:23:15.913 --> 1:23:18.833
Wait a minute. Why am I counting?
Hey, where is everyone?

1:23:18.957 --> 1:23:23.207
Uh-oh, did they leave me? No! No, no.
They wouldn't do that.

1:23:23.378 --> 1:23:26.258
Okay. That's okay. I can figure this out.
What was I just doing then?

1:23:26.423 --> 1:23:30.433
I was covering my face,
so I was trying to hide.

1:23:30.594 --> 1:23:32.764
Okay, so why was I trying to hide? Wait!

1:23:32.930 --> 1:23:34.760
Oh, i-- five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

1:23:34.848 --> 1:23:36.308
Ready or not, here I come!

1:23:36.433 --> 1:23:37.773
Ha, found you!

1:23:37.935 --> 1:23:38.775
I see you!

1:23:38.894 --> 1:23:39.984
Haha! Gotcha!

1:23:40.145 --> 1:23:42.105
All right, you little shrimps,
recess is over.

1:23:42.272 --> 1:23:44.442
-Aw, man.
-Ah, nobody found me!

1:23:44.608 --> 1:23:46.528
Bring it in. Time for another--

1:23:46.610 --> 1:23:48.150
don't touch me.
Time for another lesson.

1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:50.820
When is Mr. ray coming back
from his migration?

1:23:50.989 --> 1:23:53.119
If he's smart he'll stay away from here
as long as he can.

1:23:53.283 --> 1:23:55.123
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.

1:23:55.285 --> 1:23:57.615
Okay kids, who wants to learn
about echolocation?

1:23:57.788 --> 1:23:58.998
-Boo.
-Nobody.

1:23:59.122 --> 1:24:01.422
Oh, come on, guys.
It's actually really cool.

1:24:01.583 --> 1:24:03.133
Okay, kelpcake. Have fun.

1:24:03.293 --> 1:24:04.923
Nice day for a swim, huh?

1:24:05.087 --> 1:24:06.957
All right. Bye mom. Bye dad.

1:24:07.130 --> 1:24:10.630
Well, I guess we'll go back home
and brush up on the anemone.

1:24:10.801 --> 1:24:12.091
You coming, dory?

1:24:12.261 --> 1:24:14.221
Me? Oh I'm just going to the dropoff.

1:24:14.805 --> 1:24:20.145
Oh, okay. What? The dropoff? No!
That's-- that's a good idea?

1:24:20.310 --> 1:24:23.360
Yeah. I just thought
I'd go enjoy the view. Bye.

1:24:24.064 --> 1:24:26.944
The view. Well, you have a good time!

1:24:27.109 --> 1:24:31.649
All by yourself. Not getting lost.

1:24:44.168 --> 1:24:45.458
Oh!

1:24:45.586 --> 1:24:46.746
Huh?

1:24:50.132 --> 1:24:55.352
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
No, no, dory. Dory. Dory! D--

1:25:08.317 --> 1:25:10.487
-hey, marlin.
-Oh, hey. Hello, dory.

1:25:10.652 --> 1:25:12.112
You all right? You look worried.

1:25:12.279 --> 1:25:15.619
No, no, no. I'm fine.
It's how I always look.

1:25:20.412 --> 1:25:21.582
What?

1:25:21.663 --> 1:25:23.293
Well, I just--

1:25:24.958 --> 1:25:26.458
you did it.

1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:30.550
-Yay!
-You did it, kelpcake.

1:25:30.714 --> 1:25:33.224
-Yes!
-Did what?

1:25:33.342 --> 1:25:38.472
Sweetie, you just followed the shells
all the way back home.

1:25:38.597 --> 1:25:41.847
Oh, my gosh! I did? All by myself?

1:25:41.975 --> 1:25:44.305
-Yeah.
-Do you know what this means?

1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:49.480
It means you can do
whatever you put your mind to, dory.

1:25:49.650 --> 1:25:50.690
Really?

1:25:53.070 --> 1:25:55.070
Mommy, can I go play with them?

1:25:55.739 --> 1:25:59.159
-Yes.
-Absolutely! Go get them, kelpcake.

1:26:04.706 --> 1:26:06.916
Yeah. I did it.

1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:12.550
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

1:26:17.845 --> 1:26:19.725
It really is quite a view.

1:26:23.892 --> 1:26:24.772
Yep.

1:26:26.270 --> 1:26:28.020
Unforgettable.

1:26:39.575 --> 1:26:46.545
The end

1:35:24.641 --> 1:35:28.481
off, off, off, off, off, off,
off, off, off, off!

1:35:31.273 --> 1:35:34.943
Come on. Roll, roll. That's it. Hurry!
That's it. Just roll!

1:35:35.110 --> 1:35:35.820
I'm right behind you.

1:35:35.986 --> 1:35:38.486
You can do it! Just a little farther.
That's it!

1:35:38.655 --> 1:35:40.815
I am truly going to vomit!

1:35:41.491 --> 1:35:44.161
-Voilà!
-All right, gang, good work.

1:35:45.621 --> 1:35:47.831
Look, flo, we made it!

1:35:47.998 --> 1:35:50.578
We won't have any more problems
from here on out.

1:35:53.170 --> 1:35:54.500
No respect for ocean life.

1:35:55.506 --> 1:35:56.506
Now what?
