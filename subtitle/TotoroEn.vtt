0:02:32.152 --> 0:02:33.950
Dad, do you want a caramel?

0:02:33.945 --> 0:02:36.869
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

0:02:36.865 --> 0:02:37.741
All right.

0:02:37.741 --> 0:02:38.867
We're almost there.

0:02:50.379 --> 0:02:51.380
Mei, hide!

0:02:57.552 --> 0:02:59.225
It wasn't a policeman.

0:03:31.962 --> 0:03:34.761
Hello. Are your parents around?

0:03:36.842 --> 0:03:38.094
Thanks.

0:03:40.262 --> 0:03:44.187
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

0:03:44.933 --> 0:03:47.186
A pleasure to meet you!

0:03:47.436 --> 0:03:48.983
Welcome!

0:03:54.276 --> 0:03:55.823
Thank you.

0:04:17.591 --> 0:04:18.467
Here we are!

0:04:19.760 --> 0:04:21.637
Wait!

0:04:24.639 --> 0:04:26.107
Mei, there's a bridge!

0:04:26.099 --> 0:04:27.316
A bridge?

0:04:32.397 --> 0:04:34.741
See that flash? Fish too!

0:04:35.609 --> 0:04:37.236
So, you like it here?

0:04:39.863 --> 0:04:42.036
Dad, it's terrific!

0:04:42.365 --> 0:04:43.867
Look, a tunnel of trees!

0:04:46.286 --> 0:04:48.539
Is that our house?

0:04:52.667 --> 0:04:54.260
Come on!

0:05:07.140 --> 0:05:09.313
It's a wreck!

0:05:09.309 --> 0:05:10.856
Wreck!

0:05:10.852 --> 0:05:12.525
Looks like a haunted house!

0:05:12.521 --> 0:05:13.363
Haunted?

0:05:21.112 --> 0:05:22.364
And it's all rotten!

0:05:34.042 --> 0:05:35.760
It's gonna fall down!

0:05:35.752 --> 0:05:37.550
Fall down!

0:05:47.472 --> 0:05:49.190
Look, Mei!

0:05:51.601 --> 0:05:52.898
See?

0:06:02.028 --> 0:06:03.746
It's huge.

0:06:09.369 --> 0:06:11.838
Dad, there's a huge tree!

0:06:12.581 --> 0:06:14.424
It's a camphor tree.

0:06:16.418 --> 0:06:18.420
Camphor tree...

0:06:27.679 --> 0:06:28.601
Oops!

0:06:31.266 --> 0:06:32.142
An acorn!

0:06:33.935 --> 0:06:35.778
Show me.

0:06:37.272 --> 0:06:38.774
Another one!

0:06:43.820 --> 0:06:46.289
One for me!

0:06:52.245 --> 0:06:54.839
Out of the way.
I can't open the screens.

0:06:55.498 --> 0:06:56.624
Acorns!

0:06:56.625 --> 0:06:59.128
There's acorns in the house.

0:06:59.127 --> 0:07:00.629
They dropped from up there!

0:07:05.133 --> 0:07:08.137
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

0:07:08.470 --> 0:07:10.063
Squirrels, really?

0:07:10.805 --> 0:07:12.978
Or rats that like acorns.

0:07:13.975 --> 0:07:15.648
I'd rather have squirrels!

0:07:16.144 --> 0:07:18.146
Where shall I put this?

0:07:18.813 --> 0:07:23.319
Here, I'll get the door for you.
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

0:07:23.985 --> 0:07:25.532
It's just round the back.

0:07:27.989 --> 0:07:29.161
Mei, come on!

0:07:30.617 --> 0:07:32.164
Wait for me!

0:07:33.578 --> 0:07:35.251
Hurry!

0:08:13.326 --> 0:08:14.418
Ready?

0:08:26.881 --> 0:08:28.133
Bathtubs.

0:08:34.180 --> 0:08:35.523
There's nothing here.

0:08:37.726 --> 0:08:39.023
That's the bathroom.

0:08:39.019 --> 0:08:40.942
Dad, there's something in here.

0:08:40.937 --> 0:08:41.904
A squirrel?

0:08:41.896 --> 0:08:46.777
Dunno. A bunch of black things
but not roaches or mice.

0:08:46.776 --> 0:08:48.449
Really?

0:09:00.081 --> 0:09:01.207
Can you see 'em?

0:09:02.500 --> 0:09:04.298
I think they were...dustbunnies.

0:09:04.711 --> 0:09:07.464
'Dustbunnies'?
Like in my picture book?

0:09:07.464 --> 0:09:10.889
That's right. Ghosts don't come out
on days like this.

0:09:16.306 --> 0:09:18.650
When you walk into a dark room
from outside,

0:09:19.184 --> 0:09:21.778
your eyes dim and
so the dustbunnies come out.

0:09:22.103 --> 0:09:23.320
I see.

0:09:23.855 --> 0:09:30.454
Come here, dustbunnies.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

0:09:35.992 --> 0:09:40.338
Let's get to work! See if you can find
how to get upstairs.

0:09:42.207 --> 0:09:44.926
Get up there and
open all the windows.

0:09:45.335 --> 0:09:46.461
Sure!

0:09:46.461 --> 0:09:47.963
I'm coming, too!

0:09:56.638 --> 0:09:58.106
Toilet!

0:10:00.433 --> 0:10:01.559
Not here!

0:10:19.160 --> 0:10:20.207
Nothing here!

0:10:20.870 --> 0:10:22.338
Nothing!

0:10:32.173 --> 0:10:34.267
Mei, it's here!

0:10:40.974 --> 0:10:42.476
It's pitch black!

0:10:42.725 --> 0:10:44.352
Dustbunnies...

0:10:52.610 --> 0:10:53.953
Another acorn.

0:11:00.243 --> 0:11:04.043
Come out, dustbunnies!

0:11:43.494 --> 0:11:47.169
Are you there, Mr. Dustbunny?

0:12:12.815 --> 0:12:16.661
Dad, there's definitely
something here!

0:12:16.861 --> 0:12:22.959
That's exciting! I've always
wanted to live in a haunted house.

0:12:25.954 --> 0:12:27.251
I'm coming!

0:13:12.583 --> 0:13:15.006
I got it. Satsuki!

0:13:28.558 --> 0:13:29.605
Mei.

0:13:40.236 --> 0:13:42.159
You're full of energy!

0:13:42.447 --> 0:13:46.918
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after
the house and came to help.

0:13:47.618 --> 0:13:51.043
I'm Satsuki and
this is my sister, Mei.

0:13:51.039 --> 0:13:53.918
Nice to meet you both.

0:13:53.916 --> 0:14:00.344
I'd have cleaned up
if I'd known you'd be this quick.

0:14:01.007 --> 0:14:02.725
No, you've done plenty.

0:14:03.051 --> 0:14:08.273
Lately I've been so busy in the rice
paddies, I only did a bit of dusting...

0:14:09.599 --> 0:14:12.478
What have you done to your hands?

0:14:12.477 --> 0:14:14.855
The dustbunny got away...

0:14:14.854 --> 0:14:16.777
Your feet, too!

0:14:20.943 --> 0:14:22.911
Mine are black, too!

0:14:31.913 --> 0:14:34.132
That must be the 'soot spreaders'.

0:14:34.374 --> 0:14:40.632
Those little, black,
fuzzy things that fly?

0:14:40.630 --> 0:14:45.386
That's right.
They breed in empty old houses,

0:14:45.385 --> 0:14:49.060
and cover them with soot and dust.

0:14:50.223 --> 0:14:57.653
I could see them when I was little.
Now you can too, huh?

0:14:57.647 --> 0:14:59.274
Are they like goblins or something?

0:14:59.732 --> 0:15:03.862
Naah, nothing so scary.

0:15:03.861 --> 0:15:09.243
If you keep smiling,
they'll soon leave the house.

0:15:10.785 --> 0:15:15.131
They're probably deciding
where to go next, right now.

0:15:20.878 --> 0:15:22.846
Mei, they're going away.

0:15:22.839 --> 0:15:23.840
That's no fun.

0:15:23.840 --> 0:15:26.434
What happens if a huge one
comes out, like this?

0:15:26.843 --> 0:15:28.140
I wouldn't be scared.

0:15:28.469 --> 0:15:32.144
Okay then, I won't walk you to
the bathroom at night.

0:15:34.475 --> 0:15:39.606
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get
some water from the stream?

0:15:39.605 --> 0:15:40.777
From the stream?

0:15:40.773 --> 0:15:41.990
I'm coming, too!

0:15:45.611 --> 0:15:47.329
Mei, wait there.

0:15:56.706 --> 0:15:58.674
Did you get a fish?

0:16:10.344 --> 0:16:12.221
Nanny, it's coming out!

0:16:12.680 --> 0:16:17.231
Good, keep pumping 'til the water
gets cold.

0:16:17.602 --> 0:16:19.024
Okay!

0:17:00.937 --> 0:17:03.907
May I help you?

0:17:05.358 --> 0:17:07.907
Huh... my Mom... for Granny.

0:17:09.987 --> 0:17:11.113
Yes?

0:17:17.286 --> 0:17:18.913
Wait, what is it?

0:17:19.914 --> 0:17:21.712
Is that you, Kanta?

0:17:23.417 --> 0:17:28.719
You live in a haunted house!

0:17:29.090 --> 0:17:30.216
Kanta, stop it!

0:17:40.560 --> 0:17:43.063
I did the same when I was his age.

0:17:43.688 --> 0:17:48.694
I hate boys.
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

0:17:49.235 --> 0:17:51.237
Eat as much as you want.

0:17:51.904 --> 0:17:53.406
Thank you!

0:17:56.367 --> 0:17:58.244
Thank you very much for your help.

0:17:59.537 --> 0:18:01.756
Good bye!

0:19:16.364 --> 0:19:19.368
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

0:19:21.661 --> 0:19:24.540
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

0:19:59.615 --> 0:20:02.915
Come on, let's laugh to keep
the bogeymen away!

0:20:05.162 --> 0:20:06.914
I'm not scared.

0:20:08.249 --> 0:20:09.796
I mean it. I'm not scared!

0:20:53.961 --> 0:20:55.963
One-two, one-two...

0:20:57.256 --> 0:21:00.635
Come on, keep up the good work...

0:21:05.973 --> 0:21:08.852
Okay! Washing...finished!

0:21:18.319 --> 0:21:20.242
Here we go!

0:21:37.338 --> 0:21:39.841
Nanny!

0:21:40.424 --> 0:21:42.518
Hello!

0:21:42.510 --> 0:21:44.012
Hard at work?

0:21:44.512 --> 0:21:46.731
Where're you all heading?

0:21:47.264 --> 0:21:50.017
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

0:21:50.351 --> 0:21:54.857
That's nice.
Give her my regards!

0:22:13.374 --> 0:22:15.092
This way.

0:22:42.069 --> 0:22:42.911
Hello.

0:22:43.195 --> 0:22:44.697
Hello there.

0:22:46.282 --> 0:22:47.408
Mommy!

0:22:47.408 --> 0:22:50.002
So glad you came, my dear.

0:22:49.994 --> 0:22:52.417
Daddy took the wrong road.

0:22:52.413 --> 0:22:55.257
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

0:22:55.249 --> 0:22:57.126
It's a school holiday, today.

0:22:57.126 --> 0:22:58.594
How nice.

0:22:58.586 --> 0:23:01.339
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

0:23:01.338 --> 0:23:03.261
It's so good to see you all.

0:23:03.757 --> 0:23:06.431
Have you settled into the new house?

0:23:12.558 --> 0:23:14.151
A haunted house?

0:23:14.685 --> 0:23:16.904
Mom, do you like ghosts?

0:23:17.146 --> 0:23:20.616
Of course I do!
I can't wait to see them.

0:23:20.608 --> 0:23:22.076
See, I told you Mei.

0:23:23.110 --> 0:23:26.785
Mei was worried that
you wouldn't like ghosts.

0:23:26.780 --> 0:23:28.032
What about you two?

0:23:28.032 --> 0:23:29.079
I love them!

0:23:29.074 --> 0:23:30.917
I'm not scared of them!

0:23:33.245 --> 0:23:35.964
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

0:23:37.124 --> 0:23:39.593
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

0:23:40.961 --> 0:23:43.305
But she always gets mad at me.

0:23:43.297 --> 0:23:45.095
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

0:23:45.090 --> 0:23:47.092
Come here, Satsuki.

0:23:47.718 --> 0:23:49.641
Isn't yours too short?

0:23:49.637 --> 0:23:50.889
No, I like it like this.

0:23:50.888 --> 0:23:52.936
Do mine, Mommy! Mine, too!

0:23:52.932 --> 0:23:53.808
Wait your turn!

0:23:54.516 --> 0:23:59.397
Wavy hair, just like mine
when I was your age.

0:23:59.396 --> 0:24:03.321
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

0:24:03.776 --> 0:24:07.497
Probably. You take after your Mom.

0:24:25.172 --> 0:24:27.266
Mom looked really well.

0:24:27.257 --> 0:24:31.057
You're right. The doctor says
she'll be home soon.

0:24:31.720 --> 0:24:33.347
Soon? Like tomorrow?

0:24:33.722 --> 0:24:35.850
You always say this.

0:24:35.849 --> 0:24:37.522
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

0:24:38.352 --> 0:24:41.322
Mom said she'll sleep with me
in my bed.

0:24:41.522 --> 0:24:45.823
Weren't you saying
you're big enough to sleep alone?

0:24:45.818 --> 0:24:47.946
Mom is special!

0:25:09.508 --> 0:25:12.933
Dad, time to get up!

0:25:16.765 --> 0:25:19.143
Wake up!

0:25:24.565 --> 0:25:26.317
Sorry, I overslept again...

0:25:26.316 --> 0:25:28.239
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

0:25:28.610 --> 0:25:30.578
I totally forgot about it.

0:25:31.113 --> 0:25:33.741
It's all right.
I've made something for all of us.

0:25:33.741 --> 0:25:34.708
It's burning!

0:25:34.700 --> 0:25:35.542
I'm coming.

0:25:38.495 --> 0:25:40.497
Here, this is yours, Mei.

0:25:41.290 --> 0:25:42.667
It's for me?

0:25:43.459 --> 0:25:45.052
Mei, sit down and eat!

0:25:47.629 --> 0:25:49.256
Here, wrap yours.

0:25:52.509 --> 0:25:55.262
Satsuki!

0:25:55.512 --> 0:25:56.809
- oh.

0:25:56.805 --> 0:25:59.433
I'm coming!

0:26:01.101 --> 0:26:02.944
You made a friend already?

0:26:02.936 --> 0:26:04.938
She's calling you!

0:26:05.355 --> 0:26:07.073
Yup, that's Michiko.

0:26:09.359 --> 0:26:10.906
Gotta go!

0:26:12.404 --> 0:26:13.997
See ya!

0:26:14.281 --> 0:26:16.283
See you later!

0:26:17.618 --> 0:26:18.665
Morning!

0:26:18.911 --> 0:26:20.959
Hi, let's go.

0:26:33.342 --> 0:26:34.935
Daddy!

0:26:36.011 --> 0:26:37.809
Do I look all grown up?

0:26:37.805 --> 0:26:40.149
Yes dear.
And where might you be going?

0:26:40.140 --> 0:26:41.938
I'm just going out.

0:27:04.289 --> 0:27:06.508
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

0:27:06.500 --> 0:27:08.753
Already?

0:27:20.848 --> 0:27:23.442
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

0:27:39.491 --> 0:27:41.038
Pole-tads!

0:27:59.428 --> 0:28:02.227
Got no bottom.

0:28:15.569 --> 0:28:16.741
Gotcha!

0:33:53.448 --> 0:33:56.452
Who are you? A big Dustbunny?

0:34:24.563 --> 0:34:27.658
To-to-ro? You're Totoro!

0:34:32.821 --> 0:34:34.915
I bet you're Totoro.

0:35:47.020 --> 0:35:47.816
See you!

0:35:47.812 --> 0:35:48.938
Okay, catch you later!

0:35:51.399 --> 0:35:52.275
I'm home!

0:35:52.275 --> 0:35:55.199
Hey there. Is it that late already?

0:35:55.195 --> 0:35:57.243
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

0:35:57.238 --> 0:36:00.663
We haven't eaten yet.
ls Mei in the garden?

0:36:02.952 --> 0:36:04.545
Mei!

0:36:17.842 --> 0:36:21.722
Dad, I found her hat!

0:36:45.870 --> 0:36:48.339
Wake up, Mei!

0:36:49.874 --> 0:36:52.093
You shouldn't sleep here!

0:36:54.003 --> 0:36:55.255
Where's Totoro?

0:36:55.255 --> 0:36:56.598
Totoro?

0:36:56.589 --> 0:36:59.138
Where?

0:37:01.553 --> 0:37:03.180
Were you dreaming?

0:37:03.430 --> 0:37:04.898
Totoro was here.

0:37:05.265 --> 0:37:08.109
You mean that troll
in your picture book?

0:37:08.435 --> 0:37:15.614
Yeah. He was all hairy with
a big mouth like this.

0:37:15.608 --> 0:37:22.287
There's a tiny one and a little one
and a huge one like this.

0:37:26.161 --> 0:37:29.586
There you are.
Wow, this is amazing.

0:37:30.415 --> 0:37:31.712
A great hiding place!

0:37:31.916 --> 0:37:35.386
Dad, Mei said she met a Totoro here.

0:37:35.378 --> 0:37:36.504
A Totoro?

0:37:37.130 --> 0:37:38.302
It's this way.

0:37:46.639 --> 0:37:48.357
Hey, wait for me!

0:37:50.143 --> 0:37:51.645
Huh?!

0:37:53.897 --> 0:37:55.023
Here?

0:37:55.023 --> 0:37:56.320
No.

0:37:56.733 --> 0:37:59.202
It went to a big tree.

0:37:59.194 --> 0:38:01.288
But there wasn't any other path.

0:38:01.905 --> 0:38:04.533
Mei! Come back!

0:38:19.422 --> 0:38:23.177
But it's true! Totoro was here.

0:38:23.760 --> 0:38:25.012
I'm not lying.

0:38:34.312 --> 0:38:35.484
I know, Mei.

0:38:36.064 --> 0:38:37.782
I didn't lie.

0:38:37.774 --> 0:38:43.031
Neither of us think you're lying.

0:38:43.530 --> 0:38:49.003
You probably met the king of this forest.
You were very lucky.

0:38:49.744 --> 0:38:52.668
He doesn't come out very often.

0:38:54.165 --> 0:38:56.588
We should pay our respects
at the shrine.

0:38:56.584 --> 0:38:57.585
Pay our respects?

0:38:57.585 --> 0:38:59.212
To this forest.

0:39:15.812 --> 0:39:18.907
Mei, you're getting heavy.

0:39:18.898 --> 0:39:20.571
Daddy, look! That camphor tree!

0:39:21.776 --> 0:39:22.948
What a big tree.

0:39:31.244 --> 0:39:32.040
It's here!

0:39:33.580 --> 0:39:34.706
Is that the tree?

0:39:35.623 --> 0:39:38.092
Dad, hurry up.

0:39:48.928 --> 0:39:51.056
The hole has gone.

0:39:51.055 --> 0:39:52.432
Are you sure it was here?

0:39:54.100 --> 0:39:56.102
The hole disappeared.

0:39:56.102 --> 0:39:58.571
I told you he doesn't come
to see us often.

0:39:58.813 --> 0:40:01.316
But will he come again?
I want to meet him, too.

0:40:02.275 --> 0:40:05.028
If you're lucky, sure.

0:40:06.279 --> 0:40:07.997
What a beautiful tree.

0:40:09.657 --> 0:40:14.003
This tree must have stood here
for years and years.

0:40:15.330 --> 0:40:19.301
Trees and people
used to be good friends.

0:40:20.376 --> 0:40:27.260
I saw that tree and fell in love with
the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

0:40:27.467 --> 0:40:30.812
Okay, let's pay our respects
then get home for lunch.

0:40:30.803 --> 0:40:33.477
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

0:40:33.473 --> 0:40:34.941
I want to go, too!

0:40:35.224 --> 0:40:36.316
Attention!

0:40:36.851 --> 0:40:41.448
Thank you for looking after Mei.

0:40:41.439 --> 0:40:43.658
Please take care of us.

0:40:44.484 --> 0:40:45.610
Let's race home!

0:40:45.610 --> 0:40:47.078
That's not fair! Dad!

0:40:48.488 --> 0:40:50.161
Wait!

0:40:51.574 --> 0:40:53.497
Hurry UP!

0:40:53.493 --> 0:40:55.666
Wait for me!

0:40:57.830 --> 0:41:00.458
Dear Mother, something amazing
happened today.

0:41:01.167 --> 0:41:04.512
Mei met a giant Totoro.

0:41:09.509 --> 0:41:13.980
And I'm hoping to see him
myself soon, too.

0:41:44.168 --> 0:41:47.388
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

0:41:47.380 --> 0:41:48.381
Coming...

0:42:31.090 --> 0:42:32.216
Mei?

0:42:32.925 --> 0:42:34.097
Excuse me!

0:42:34.093 --> 0:42:35.470
Yes, Satsuki?

0:42:36.137 --> 0:42:37.889
It's my sister...

0:42:44.979 --> 0:42:46.902
What happened, Nanny?

0:42:46.898 --> 0:42:51.449
I'm sorry. She insisted that
she be with you.

0:42:51.944 --> 0:42:56.495
It's Dad's day at the university.

0:42:56.491 --> 0:42:59.495
You promised to be
a good girl at Nanny's.

0:43:02.455 --> 0:43:06.801
I still have two more classes
and Nanny's too busy for this...

0:43:07.126 --> 0:43:12.132
She was good up 'til now,
weren't you?

0:43:19.514 --> 0:43:21.687
I'll go talk to my teacher.

0:43:27.772 --> 0:43:34.997
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital,
I want you all to be nice to her.

0:43:42.036 --> 0:43:43.458
What's that?

0:43:43.663 --> 0:43:45.006
It's Totoro.

0:43:45.456 --> 0:43:48.630
Mei, you should keep quiet.

0:43:48.626 --> 0:43:49.673
okay.

0:44:00.012 --> 0:44:02.481
Bye bye, Mei!

0:44:03.015 --> 0:44:04.562
I can't stay after class today.

0:44:04.559 --> 0:44:06.607
We'll let teacher know.

0:44:06.602 --> 0:44:08.149
See you!

0:44:09.856 --> 0:44:11.699
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

0:44:11.691 --> 0:44:12.692
okay

0:44:20.575 --> 0:44:22.122
Here it comes!

0:44:34.380 --> 0:44:35.222
Here.

0:44:39.218 --> 0:44:41.562
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

0:44:44.098 --> 0:44:46.726
It's getting worse...

0:44:48.895 --> 0:44:52.274
Dear Guardian Spirit,
let us stay until the rain stops.

0:45:35.942 --> 0:45:37.159
But...

0:45:57.463 --> 0:45:59.591
That was lucky.

0:46:00.675 --> 0:46:02.848
It's got holes in it.

0:46:14.522 --> 0:46:17.116
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

0:46:17.108 --> 0:46:18.576
I'm going, too.

0:46:22.071 --> 0:46:23.994
I said I forgot it!

0:46:23.990 --> 0:46:27.369
What idiot forgets his umbrella
on a rainy day?

0:46:27.743 --> 0:46:29.290
Ouch!

0:46:29.537 --> 0:46:31.835
You broke it playing, I bet.

0:46:31.831 --> 0:46:33.128
I did not!

0:46:46.470 --> 0:46:47.892
Excuse me.

0:46:50.057 --> 0:46:53.732
Hello Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

0:46:55.229 --> 0:46:56.856
I'm sorry about Mei today.

0:46:56.856 --> 0:46:58.699
Not at all.
Sorry we couldn't do more.

0:46:59.191 --> 0:47:02.365
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

0:47:02.361 --> 0:47:06.036
He did?
A broken old thing like that!

0:47:06.532 --> 0:47:08.785
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

0:47:08.784 --> 0:47:12.414
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

0:47:12.705 --> 0:47:17.427
Not at all. It probably
cleaned him up a little.

0:47:17.793 --> 0:47:19.386
Are you off to meet your father?

0:47:19.378 --> 0:47:20.254
YES.

0:47:20.254 --> 0:47:21.722
What good girls you are.

0:47:22.214 --> 0:47:24.216
Bye bye, Mei.

0:47:35.186 --> 0:47:37.063
Who was that?

0:47:37.063 --> 0:47:38.030
I don't know.

0:47:42.568 --> 0:47:44.536
Just in time!

0:47:57.583 --> 0:47:58.755
Getting on?

0:48:00.211 --> 0:48:02.009
All right, drive on.

0:48:10.262 --> 0:48:12.606
Daddy wasn't on it.

0:48:12.598 --> 0:48:16.944
He'll be on the next one.
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

0:48:52.888 --> 0:48:54.231
Are you okay?

0:49:27.798 --> 0:49:29.050
Sleepy?

0:49:29.967 --> 0:49:33.847
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

0:49:36.015 --> 0:49:37.813
It won't be much longer.
Hang in there.

0:49:44.190 --> 0:49:46.818
It's late...

0:49:54.450 --> 0:49:55.451
Come on.

0:51:19.159 --> 0:51:20.160
Are you Totoro?

0:51:30.379 --> 0:51:32.097
Wait a minute.

0:51:37.803 --> 0:51:39.180
You can use this.

0:51:40.472 --> 0:51:42.600
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

0:51:48.981 --> 0:51:50.608
Hold it like this.

0:53:07.559 --> 0:53:08.776
Here's the bus!

0:54:16.336 --> 0:54:19.966
He took Daddy's umbrella...

0:54:33.145 --> 0:54:34.647
I'm sorry.

0:54:34.646 --> 0:54:35.772
All right, drive on.

0:54:36.523 --> 0:54:39.652
The train was late
and I missed the bus.

0:54:40.444 --> 0:54:42.037
Were you worried?

0:54:42.654 --> 0:54:44.907
We met him, Dad! He was here!

0:54:44.907 --> 0:54:46.659
And the cat bus!

0:54:47.075 --> 0:54:48.167
What?

0:54:48.494 --> 0:54:50.337
It was huge!

0:54:50.329 --> 0:54:54.175
With big eyes like these!

0:54:55.292 --> 0:54:59.217
We met him! We met Totoro!

0:54:59.838 --> 0:55:01.556
How wonderful!

0:55:13.101 --> 0:55:14.478
Come on, Daddy.

0:55:22.528 --> 0:55:26.408
<i>Dear /I//other, I can '2' tell you
how excited I was today.</i>

0:55:26.406 --> 0:55:31.207
it was the scariest, funniest day
I've ever had.

0:55:31.203 --> 0:55:33.626
Totoro gave us a lovely present...

0:55:33.872 --> 0:55:38.378
wrapped in bamboo /eaves and
tied with dragon whiskers.

0:55:38.377 --> 0:55:43.383
<i>when we opened it,
it was full of magic nuts and seeds!</i>

0:55:48.095 --> 0:55:54.273
'We decided to plant them in the garden
to make a lovely forest.'

0:55:54.268 --> 0:56:00.992
But they haven 't sprouted yet.
Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

0:56:02.109 --> 0:56:05.739
<i>She looks like a little crab</i>

0:56:10.784 --> 0:56:12.661
It's nearly summer vacation.

0:56:12.661 --> 0:56:16.962
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon.
Love, Satsuki.

0:56:20.502 --> 0:56:22.379
Come on. Bed time.

0:56:26.341 --> 0:56:27.388
Lights off!

0:56:27.384 --> 0:56:28.886
Wait, Dad.

0:56:29.261 --> 0:56:32.105
Daddy, do you think they will
sprout tomorrow?

0:56:32.431 --> 0:56:37.528
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.
Night night.

0:57:26.360 --> 0:57:27.737
Mei!

0:57:45.712 --> 0:57:47.555
That's where we planted the seeds.

0:59:19.931 --> 0:59:22.184
Wow, we did it!

1:00:37.759 --> 1:00:40.387
We're the wind!

1:01:41.281 --> 1:01:42.999
There are no trees!

1:01:47.913 --> 1:01:49.586
yes

1:01:52.876 --> 1:01:53.923
It was a dream.

1:01:53.919 --> 1:01:56.217
But it wasn't a dream.

1:01:57.631 --> 1:02:00.885
We did it!

1:02:17.442 --> 1:02:22.949
Mr. Kusakabe! Telegram!

1:02:27.410 --> 1:02:29.128
Anyone home?

1:02:35.877 --> 1:02:38.175
Nanny.

1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:43.802
I'm here.

1:02:45.679 --> 1:02:47.807
This one is ripe.

1:02:56.982 --> 1:02:58.529
What about this one?

1:02:58.525 --> 1:03:00.027
That's good, too.

1:03:06.241 --> 1:03:09.461
Your garden's a treasure house.

1:03:10.078 --> 1:03:12.501
Let's take a little break.

1:03:18.545 --> 1:03:21.298
These should be cold now.

1:03:21.673 --> 1:03:23.300
Looks delicious.

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:34.186
So good.

1:03:34.185 --> 1:03:40.033
The sun blessed these so
they're really good for you.

1:03:40.442 --> 1:03:42.444
Would they help my Mom, too?

1:03:42.444 --> 1:03:47.371
Of course. If she eats my vegetables,
she'll get better right away.

1:03:47.782 --> 1:03:50.535
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

1:03:50.535 --> 1:03:52.583
She'll sleep in my bed!

1:03:53.330 --> 1:03:56.209
At last. That's wonderful.

1:03:56.207 --> 1:04:02.556
But it's only for a couple of days.
To get used to the new house.

1:04:03.173 --> 1:04:07.303
I see. We'll feed her lots of
vegetables, then.

1:04:07.302 --> 1:04:10.727
I'll give her this corn I picked.

1:04:11.056 --> 1:04:12.899
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

1:04:13.266 --> 1:04:14.734
Yes!

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.619
There was a telegram for you.

1:04:24.611 --> 1:04:25.533
For us?

1:04:29.783 --> 1:04:32.081
Dad won't be back till late,
what shall I do?

1:04:32.577 --> 1:04:35.080
Open it, it might be important.

1:04:39.084 --> 1:04:42.805
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL...

1:04:43.171 --> 1:04:48.302
It's from Mom's hospital!
Something's happened to her!

1:04:50.512 --> 1:04:52.731
Nanny! What shall I do?

1:04:52.722 --> 1:04:56.943
Calm down. Do you know
where your Dad is?

1:04:56.935 --> 1:05:00.280
I know his office number,
but we don't have a telephone.

1:05:00.271 --> 1:05:04.492
Kanta, take her to use the phone
in the main house!

1:05:09.656 --> 1:05:12.705
Mei, stay here with me!

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:23.628
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

1:06:01.166 --> 1:06:04.010
Hello, I'd like to make a
long-distance call, please.

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:09.391
It's Tokyo 31 '1382.

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:13.891
A cute girl, Kanta.

1:06:16.514 --> 1:06:18.812
Hello? Yes?

1:06:20.101 --> 1:06:24.902
Hello, may I speak to
Dad... er... Mr. Kusakabe?

1:06:25.857 --> 1:06:27.700
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

1:06:31.779 --> 1:06:33.702
Daddy? It's me, Satsuki!

1:06:34.032 --> 1:06:39.880
Hello, what's up? From the hospital?

1:06:39.871 --> 1:06:42.715
Okay, /'// ca// them right away.

1:06:42.707 --> 1:06:45.711
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

1:06:45.710 --> 1:06:52.184
Don 't' worry.
/'// check and call you right back.

1:06:53.718 --> 1:06:55.345
I'm hanging up now, stay there.

1:06:57.722 --> 1:07:01.352
May I stay here until he calls back?

1:07:01.768 --> 1:07:04.066
Stay as long as you like.

1:07:11.486 --> 1:07:13.580
Satsuki!

1:07:22.247 --> 1:07:25.251
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:30.263
No, it's my Mom's!

1:07:46.354 --> 1:07:52.487
Listen Mei. Mom's not well
so she's not coming home this time.

1:07:52.902 --> 1:07:54.074
No!

1:07:55.363 --> 1:07:58.958
There's nothing we can do.
You don't want her to get worse, do you?

1:07:59.325 --> 1:08:00.747
No!

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:04.168
It's just for a few more days.

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:09.469
So you don't care
if she dies, do you?

1:08:12.088 --> 1:08:14.432
Stop being silly! I'm going.

1:08:25.476 --> 1:08:26.477
Let's go, Mei.

1:08:30.148 --> 1:08:33.652
I hate you, Satsuki!

1:09:00.428 --> 1:09:04.103
We should bring the washing in...

1:09:04.724 --> 1:09:11.573
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

1:09:15.443 --> 1:09:19.573
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital
to check on her.

1:09:20.281 --> 1:09:27.005
Besides, it's just a cold;
she'll be back next week.

1:09:31.459 --> 1:09:35.214
They said it was just a cold...

1:09:36.214 --> 1:09:37.841
when she went into hospital.

1:09:39.425 --> 1:09:41.348
But what if she dies!

1:09:41.552 --> 1:09:43.350
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

1:09:43.930 --> 1:09:46.183
Maybe Mom will...

1:09:49.727 --> 1:09:56.702
Stop it. Nobody would leave
two pretty little girls like you.

1:09:57.610 --> 1:10:01.490
There, there. Don't cry.

1:10:01.489 --> 1:10:06.211
I'll be here
until Daddy comes back, okay?

1:10:48.077 --> 1:10:51.251
Mei!

1:11:05.511 --> 1:11:06.808
Did she come back?

1:11:06.804 --> 1:11:09.273
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:13.649
That's strange.
Where has she gone?

1:11:14.145 --> 1:11:17.615
I was nasty to her,
'cause she was being silly...

1:11:17.982 --> 1:11:20.826
Maybe she's heading for
the hospital!

1:11:20.818 --> 1:11:26.871
The hospital? It would take
a grown-up three hours!

1:11:26.866 --> 1:11:27.662
I'll go look!

1:11:29.327 --> 1:11:36.302
Kanta, hurry! Tell your dad
that Mei is missing!

1:11:45.384 --> 1:11:48.058
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

1:12:05.112 --> 1:12:07.160
Excuse me.

1:12:09.075 --> 1:12:13.706
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
She's my sister.

1:12:13.704 --> 1:12:19.052
No, I don't think so.
I'm sure I would've noticed...

1:12:20.044 --> 1:12:21.842
Maybe she wasn't here.

1:12:41.190 --> 1:12:43.409
Are you sure she came this way?

1:12:43.401 --> 1:12:45.074
I don't know.

1:13:16.809 --> 1:13:18.652
Please, stop!

1:13:21.188 --> 1:13:22.565
Jerk! What are you doing?!

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:25.444
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl?

1:13:26.277 --> 1:13:27.324
Your little sister?

1:13:27.778 --> 1:13:31.328
She's four.
I think she's heading to the hospital.

1:13:31.949 --> 1:13:33.417
Did you see anyone?

1:13:33.409 --> 1:13:38.836
No. We just came from there...
but we didn't see anyone.

1:13:39.957 --> 1:13:41.755
Thanks anyway.

1:13:42.793 --> 1:13:44.636
Where have you come from?

1:13:44.629 --> 1:13:46.006
From Matsugo.

1:13:47.673 --> 1:13:49.266
Really?

1:13:50.718 --> 1:13:52.061
Good luck.

1:14:03.314 --> 1:14:04.941
Satsuki!

1:14:06.484 --> 1:14:08.703
Kanta!

1:14:09.487 --> 1:14:10.488
Find her?

1:14:10.488 --> 1:14:12.161
No. And you?

1:14:12.990 --> 1:14:17.416
Dad and the others are looking
for her. I'll go to the hospital,

1:14:17.411 --> 1:14:19.288
you go back home.

1:14:19.288 --> 1:14:23.213
I guess she got lost
on the way to the hospital.

1:14:23.668 --> 1:14:26.512
They found a sandal by the pond.

1:14:33.719 --> 1:14:36.643
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

1:14:53.698 --> 1:14:55.371
Did you find her?

1:15:26.772 --> 1:15:31.073
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

1:15:31.402 --> 1:15:33.951
It's too deep here,
better search further away!

1:15:33.946 --> 1:15:36.074
Hey, are there any poles left?

1:15:44.915 --> 1:15:46.963
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

1:15:51.756 --> 1:15:53.383
Nanny!

1:15:54.592 --> 1:15:56.435
Look, is it hers?

1:16:05.728 --> 1:16:06.650
No, it isn't.

1:16:17.573 --> 1:16:23.125
Thank heavens,
I was sure it was hers.

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:26.090
Hey, Nanny was
jumping to conclusions.

1:16:26.082 --> 1:16:27.459
It's not hers!

1:16:27.792 --> 1:16:29.715
Where's she gone then?

1:16:29.710 --> 1:16:31.303
Let's start from scratch.

1:16:31.295 --> 1:16:33.047
We better hurry,
it'll be dark soon.

1:16:33.047 --> 1:16:36.972
I really appreciate
your help, everyone.

1:16:36.967 --> 1:16:39.015
Don't worry.
Could have been any of us.

1:17:06.956 --> 1:17:10.176
Please, help me Totoro!

1:17:10.167 --> 1:17:16.015
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon.
I'm sure she's scared somewhere...

1:17:46.871 --> 1:17:47.963
Totoro!

1:17:49.915 --> 1:17:53.886
Mei is lost
and we can't find her!

1:17:54.420 --> 1:17:59.893
She must be scared,
please help me find her.

1:18:01.177 --> 1:18:03.680
I don't know what to do...

1:19:02.321 --> 1:19:03.994
They can't see the bus.

moving out of the way!

1:21:06.236 --> 1:21:08.580
Satsuki!

1:21:23.253 --> 1:21:24.254
Mei!

1:21:29.051 --> 1:21:30.177
You silly girl.

1:21:30.177 --> 1:21:32.179
I'm sorry.

1:21:34.515 --> 1:21:37.940
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

1:21:45.651 --> 1:21:48.245
HOSPITAL

1:21:49.947 --> 1:21:51.995
Will you take us to the hospital?

1:21:54.284 --> 1:21:55.957
Thank you so much.

1:22:04.837 --> 1:22:09.513
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send
a telegram just for a cold.

1:22:09.967 --> 1:22:14.313
The girls must be worried.
I'm sorry to upset them.

1:22:14.596 --> 1:22:17.395
They'll be fine.
As long as you're okay.

1:22:17.391 --> 1:22:22.443
We've all learned to cope.
This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

1:22:24.106 --> 1:22:27.656
They've put up with it so well.

1:22:27.651 --> 1:22:30.655
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki,
she's been so patient.

1:22:31.822 --> 1:22:32.948
You're right.

1:22:33.699 --> 1:22:37.829
I'm going to spoil them
for a while when I come home.

1:22:37.828 --> 1:22:38.795
No!

1:22:46.295 --> 1:22:48.263
She's laughing!

1:22:48.255 --> 1:22:50.007
Looks like she's fine.

1:22:58.265 --> 1:23:01.235
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

1:23:02.895 --> 1:23:04.067
look

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:11.862
Where did that come from?

1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:14.702
What?

1:23:15.491 --> 1:23:19.041
I could swear I just saw Satsuki
and Mei laughing up in that tree.

1:23:21.955 --> 1:23:24.208
Maybe they were too. Look.
