0:01:27.710 --> 0:01:29.170
<i>Goodbye!</i>

0:01:29.340 --> 0:01:31.250
<i>Goodbye!</i>

0:01:32.420 --> 0:01:34.130
<i>Goodbye!</i>

0:01:34.300 --> 0:01:36.590
<i>Have a good trip, Oloukine!</i>

0:01:42.600 --> 0:01:44.140
<i>Oloukine!</i>

0:03:24.330 --> 0:03:25.330
Come with me.

0:03:38.128 --> 0:03:41.510
- Oh no, it was brand new!
- Quiet down!

0:03:41.712 --> 0:03:43.322
What can you read there?

0:03:43.850 --> 0:03:45.680
"<i>Oloukine Library</i>"

0:03:49.270 --> 0:03:50.437
The library will

0:03:50.520 --> 0:03:52.805
have my grandfather's name,

0:03:52.900 --> 0:03:55.445
- do you realize?
- Yes, it's definitely him.

0:03:55.860 --> 0:03:58.230
The same joyful look.

0:04:00.450 --> 0:04:01.450
Oh!

0:04:01.530 --> 0:04:03.240
It's beautiful!

0:04:03.410 --> 0:04:04.410
He got it during

0:04:04.570 --> 0:04:06.280
his expedition among the Inuits.

0:04:06.490 --> 0:04:09.620
- Is it ivory?
- No, it's reindeer poop.

0:04:10.910 --> 0:04:13.250
But the most beautiful piece is here.

0:04:17.750 --> 0:04:19.380
Wonderful.

0:04:19.590 --> 0:04:21.880
Thanks to this, he was able to cross

0:04:22.090 --> 0:04:23.970
the Northeast Passage.

0:04:24.800 --> 0:04:25.640
You know!

0:04:25.800 --> 0:04:28.930
Between the Atlantic and the Pacific!

0:04:29.100 --> 0:04:33.020
A first, in Russia!
But his dream

0:04:33.230 --> 0:04:35.270
was the North Pole.

0:04:39.070 --> 0:04:41.400
Come on, captain, to the helm!

0:04:42.400 --> 0:04:43.990
Where is the North Pole?

0:04:44.106 --> 0:04:45.914
At the very North of the globe.

0:04:46.128 --> 0:04:49.141
It's very cold, and absolutely desertic.

0:04:49.168 --> 0:04:52.378
You have to walk on the
ice field for kilometers

0:04:52.620 --> 0:04:57.500
with sleds and dogs,
but it's so beautiful.

0:05:01.170 --> 0:05:04.010
And then, what do we do?

0:05:04.220 --> 0:05:05.680
We plant the flag!

0:05:08.300 --> 0:05:09.930
Planting the Russian flag

0:05:10.140 --> 0:05:13.430
was his obsession,
he loved his country so much.

0:05:13.600 --> 0:05:14.980
He died as a hero.

0:05:15.190 --> 0:05:16.810
You can be proud of him.

0:05:18.650 --> 0:05:19.650
Oh no!

0:05:21.653 --> 0:05:23.989
- We're going to get caught!
- No, come!

0:05:26.698 --> 0:05:30.666
And finally, Prince Tomsky, let's end
the visit with the Oloukine Library.

0:05:31.221 --> 0:05:33.301
We'll inaugurate it in a month.

0:05:34.106 --> 0:05:37.700
Very imposing statue, just like
the man himself, by the way,

0:05:37.845 --> 0:05:39.504
pretty megalomaniac.

0:05:40.320 --> 0:05:44.805
Megalomaniac, I don't know, but
a man of character for sure!

0:05:44.970 --> 0:05:48.510
And above all, a great explorer,
that sacrificed his life

0:05:48.680 --> 0:05:50.682
for the conquest of the pole.

0:05:51.260 --> 0:05:53.360
Still no trace of his ship?

0:05:53.498 --> 0:05:56.874
Sadly no, we still haven't found the Davaï.

0:05:56.980 --> 0:05:59.232
Oh yes, the Davaï, that icebreaker

0:05:59.360 --> 0:06:01.820
that cost the Empire a fortune,

0:06:01.980 --> 0:06:04.320
and was supposed unsinkable.

0:06:04.530 --> 0:06:07.525
A huge waste of money, what a shame.

0:06:12.580 --> 0:06:15.290
He's the Tsar's new scientific advisor.

0:06:15.312 --> 0:06:17.418
The women of the court
are crazy about him.

0:06:17.568 --> 0:06:19.946
The Tsar too! He swears by him.

0:06:20.250 --> 0:06:21.630
A real daddy's boy.

0:06:21.790 --> 0:06:23.920
If the Davaï was so worthless,

0:06:24.005 --> 0:06:27.380
the Tsar wouldn't have promised
one million roubles for its recovery!

0:06:28.760 --> 0:06:31.493
I'm sorry, Loujine, but
the Academy can't

0:06:31.600 --> 0:06:34.053
name its most beautiful
library after Oloukine.

0:06:34.096 --> 0:06:36.362
I don't care about
my predecessor's decisions.

0:06:36.430 --> 0:06:38.741
May I remind you that
Oloukine insulted my uncle?

0:06:39.061 --> 0:06:42.154
We can't do that to
the Count Tchernetsov!

0:06:42.341 --> 0:06:43.376
His son-in-law?

0:06:43.440 --> 0:06:47.360
He wants to become ambassador in
Rome, he won't make a scandal.

0:06:47.530 --> 0:06:51.820
But the Tchernetsov are very
influential in Saint Petersburg!

0:06:51.990 --> 0:06:54.128
Influential? I don't care, Loujine.

0:06:54.341 --> 0:06:56.709
I want to settle the matter quickly.

0:06:56.794 --> 0:06:59.830
Let them know that I'll attend
their daughter's ball tonight.

0:07:05.658 --> 0:07:07.173
Big news, dear,

0:07:07.200 --> 0:07:08.933
Prince Tomsky will be there tonight.

0:07:09.157 --> 0:07:11.024
My nomination in Rome

0:07:11.090 --> 0:07:14.437
is probably imminent,
else he wouldn't come.

0:07:14.554 --> 0:07:17.802
Don't forget it's also your
daughter's first ball.

0:07:17.936 --> 0:07:20.533
Of course not. I hope she'll
be worthy of her rank.

0:07:20.600 --> 0:07:22.400
She's so hard to predict.

0:07:22.460 --> 0:07:25.760
My father's death devastated her,
she's only starting to accept it.

0:07:25.914 --> 0:07:28.421
Maybe her ball will take
her mind off things.

0:07:30.210 --> 0:07:31.770
Did you ask to see me, father?

0:07:31.888 --> 0:07:34.890
Prince Tomsky will honor us with his presence tonight.

0:07:34.990 --> 0:07:36.528
You'll open the ball with him.

0:07:37.242 --> 0:07:38.213
Very well.

0:07:40.848 --> 0:07:42.666
A real young lady.

0:10:31.880 --> 0:10:34.309
The Count and Countess Alinovitch.

0:10:38.421 --> 0:10:41.402
The Duke and Duchess Baranovski.

0:10:47.360 --> 0:10:48.954
Finally! Where were you?

0:10:49.280 --> 0:10:51.722
Isn't that Ouloukine's gift?

0:10:51.802 --> 0:10:53.653
The Prince Vladimir Tomsky.

0:10:57.642 --> 0:11:00.453
Your Highness, it's a great honor.

0:11:01.070 --> 0:11:03.328
My respects, your ladyship.

0:11:03.500 --> 0:11:04.997
And here's our daughter, Sasha.

0:11:05.061 --> 0:11:06.682
It's her first ball.

0:11:08.752 --> 0:11:10.762
Lovely. Madam.

0:11:11.205 --> 0:11:13.792
Glad to be opening the ball with you, Prince.

0:11:17.392 --> 0:11:19.365
Beautiful couple, don't you think?

0:11:20.602 --> 0:11:23.450
<i>- Look, Tomsky is with young Sasha.
- How charming!</i>

0:11:23.968 --> 0:11:26.520
<i>He's the Tsar's new scientific advisor!</i>

0:11:48.810 --> 0:11:50.730
Prince, you're able to help me.

0:11:51.322 --> 0:11:52.373
Really?

0:11:52.533 --> 0:11:55.600
I can prove that we didn't look for
the Davaï at the right place.

0:11:55.872 --> 0:11:58.746
Interesting, but could I be useful?

0:11:59.557 --> 0:12:02.890
Only you could persuade the Tsar
to start the search again.

0:12:03.328 --> 0:12:07.140
I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow, but be assured
that I'll address this once I'm back.

0:12:08.149 --> 0:12:10.560
- How long will you be away?
- Three months.

0:12:11.690 --> 0:12:13.020
Three months?

0:12:24.240 --> 0:12:26.580
How was your waltz with Tomsky?

0:12:26.805 --> 0:12:28.309
Look at what I found.

0:12:30.325 --> 0:12:32.181
Oh no, not during your ball!

0:12:32.240 --> 0:12:34.773
It proves that Oloukine
didn't cross the Kara Sea,

0:12:34.800 --> 0:12:37.600
- but rather the Spitzberg!
- The Spitz-what? I don't get it!

0:12:37.670 --> 0:12:38.920
Come dance!

0:12:39.125 --> 0:12:43.430
It's simple! People think that in order
to go to the Pole, Oloukine

0:12:43.626 --> 0:12:47.220
- went right there, but he went left!
- So what?

0:12:47.712 --> 0:12:50.410
Then we've searched for the Davaï
at the wrong place!

0:12:50.485 --> 0:12:52.949
Let's say you're right: can't you
wait until tomorrow?

0:12:53.029 --> 0:12:55.029
No, Tomsky leaves tomorrow.

0:12:58.282 --> 0:13:01.150
We've lost enough time, let's
settle that matter and leave.

0:13:01.354 --> 0:13:03.338
Do you really think so?

0:13:03.466 --> 0:13:06.138
It's his daughter's first ball!

0:13:06.698 --> 0:13:07.818
Your Highness,

0:13:08.032 --> 0:13:10.309
sorry to interrupt, but
I have to talk to you,

0:13:10.368 --> 0:13:11.594
about my grandfather.

0:13:11.648 --> 0:13:13.408
- I've told you—
- I know, your highness,

0:13:13.466 --> 0:13:16.613
but during the winter, the access
to the Pole will be impossible,

0:13:16.650 --> 0:13:18.965
and we won't be able
to find the Davaï.

0:13:19.034 --> 0:13:23.120
The young lady pretends that Oloukine
took another path to the Pole.

0:13:24.245 --> 0:13:26.944
It doesn't seem very convincing
to me, what do you think?

0:13:30.560 --> 0:13:32.220
Yes, indeed...

0:13:32.410 --> 0:13:34.597
You see, even he agrees with me!

0:13:34.645 --> 0:13:36.208
Of course he is, he's afraid of you.

0:13:36.270 --> 0:13:38.282
Young lady, you're being insolent!

0:13:41.941 --> 0:13:43.466
Excuse me, I didn't want to be.

0:13:43.482 --> 0:13:45.632
No one has ever talked to me that way.

0:13:46.026 --> 0:13:47.056
This is intolerable.

0:13:47.562 --> 0:13:49.013
Loujine, we're leaving.

0:13:53.781 --> 0:13:55.040
This is an outrage!

0:13:55.301 --> 0:13:57.712
I won't stay here any longer!

0:14:02.778 --> 0:14:04.600
What's happening, Prince,
are you leaving?

0:14:04.704 --> 0:14:08.085
- I won't be insulted by a fifteen years old.
- Father, this is false.

0:14:08.202 --> 0:14:10.485
- I just said that in three months—
- Silence!

0:14:10.837 --> 0:14:12.309
Prince, please, stay.

0:14:12.373 --> 0:14:15.578
Enough. We'll settle that at the palace,
ten in the morning, tomorrow.

0:14:15.968 --> 0:14:19.270
But you know, I wonder if the Tsar
still can trust a man

0:14:19.440 --> 0:14:21.940
that can't even rule his own house.

0:14:27.984 --> 0:14:30.650
You see, Loujine? That wasn't so hard.

0:14:39.066 --> 0:14:42.090
Countess, please don't leave. Countess!

0:14:56.688 --> 0:14:58.202
Can I help you, mother?

0:15:00.090 --> 0:15:01.605
Your father has grounded you.

0:15:01.669 --> 0:15:03.541
You were supposed to
stay in your room.

0:15:04.020 --> 0:15:05.070
Please.

0:15:10.469 --> 0:15:12.624
I was so happy this
reception took place.

0:15:12.874 --> 0:15:15.221
Your first ball, what a waste.

0:15:15.792 --> 0:15:18.976
Mom, please forgive me,
I didn't realize.

0:15:20.650 --> 0:15:23.328
You're so much like
your grandfather.

0:15:23.456 --> 0:15:25.370
Daddy was always starting scandals,

0:15:25.397 --> 0:15:27.541
and never realized why we
were mad at him.

0:15:28.340 --> 0:15:30.858
You know, I miss his fits of anger.

0:15:44.053 --> 0:15:45.840
- Tell me it's sorted out.
- No.

0:15:46.426 --> 0:15:50.840
Tomsky didn't want to know, no Rome
embassy, and no Oloukine Library.

0:15:50.954 --> 0:15:53.080
If we found the Davaï, we
could make it up

0:15:53.365 --> 0:15:54.330
to the Tsar!

0:15:54.869 --> 0:15:57.392
- He promised one million roubles for it—
- Silence!

0:15:57.520 --> 0:16:00.485
- I've heard enough for today—
- But I know how to find it.

0:16:00.736 --> 0:16:03.653
- Why won't you believe me—
- Enough, quit dreaming!

0:16:03.754 --> 0:16:05.904
You sound like him, and his North Pole!

0:16:06.042 --> 0:16:08.277
His expedition was a total disaster!

0:16:08.613 --> 0:16:10.474
He ruined both the Empire and us!

0:16:10.970 --> 0:16:11.970
And you...

0:16:12.165 --> 0:16:14.350
I had put so much hope in you

0:16:14.510 --> 0:16:17.114
and yet you bring disgrace
upon our family!

0:19:05.866 --> 0:19:06.560
Sasha?

0:19:34.120 --> 0:19:35.114
Sasha?

0:19:35.312 --> 0:19:36.240
Sasha!

0:19:47.765 --> 0:19:48.725
Miss?

0:19:51.162 --> 0:19:53.034
Tickets, please.

0:20:01.429 --> 0:20:04.133
I beg you, gentlemen, please find her.

0:20:36.784 --> 0:20:39.130
- You can bet on that.
- Good grief!

0:22:06.200 --> 0:22:07.200
Olouk!

0:22:12.080 --> 0:22:13.750
<i>My Sashenka...</i>

0:22:14.586 --> 0:22:17.205
<i>I'll take you with me for the
next expedition,</i>

0:22:17.620 --> 0:22:18.630
<i>I promise you.</i>

0:22:25.072 --> 0:22:26.186
Careful!

0:22:27.845 --> 0:22:30.805
You should be careful and watch
your steps, young lady!

0:22:31.045 --> 0:22:32.448
Don't I deserve a kiss?

0:22:33.109 --> 0:22:36.320
Come on, calm down, you would have
ended up in the water without me!

0:22:36.390 --> 0:22:39.296
You should learn how to be
nicer with ladies, Katch!

0:22:39.488 --> 0:22:40.880
- But I—
- Shut up and go.

0:22:41.104 --> 0:22:43.909
You've got stuff to do,
we're leaving tonight.

0:22:46.512 --> 0:22:48.778
- Isn't that a reinforced hull?
- It is.

0:22:48.832 --> 0:22:50.773
You don't see those
often, around here.

0:22:51.957 --> 0:22:53.152
It's beautiful.

0:22:56.832 --> 0:22:58.874
Captain Larson, at your service.

0:22:58.992 --> 0:23:02.101
Can I accompany you back somewhere?
It's not safe around here.

0:23:02.380 --> 0:23:04.442
Captain, I'm looking for a ship

0:23:04.500 --> 0:23:06.608
that could take me to the Franz Josef Land.

0:23:07.050 --> 0:23:08.050
Franz Josef?

0:23:08.180 --> 0:23:11.408
Why would such a pretty young lady
go somewhere so remote?

0:23:11.690 --> 0:23:13.621
I'm expected there.

0:23:13.776 --> 0:23:15.813
If you can pay, we could
make that work.

0:23:16.202 --> 0:23:18.912
- Say, ten thousand roubles?
- But I don't have such an amount.

0:23:19.024 --> 0:23:21.952
That's not a problem, couldn't someone
pay for you at the arrival?

0:23:22.021 --> 0:23:24.229
No, look...

0:23:24.432 --> 0:23:26.874
- My grandfather—
- Alright, seven thousand!

0:23:27.109 --> 0:23:30.218
You won't find cheaper. Plus we're
the only ones leaving this week.

0:23:30.448 --> 0:23:33.700
Captain, I'd like to, but I can't
pay you that amount.

0:23:35.120 --> 0:23:36.272
They're so pretty.

0:23:38.410 --> 0:23:40.750
Yes, they mean a lot to me.

0:23:44.600 --> 0:23:46.853
- Do you think that—
- Sure!

0:23:47.008 --> 0:23:49.120
It's way more than
enough for the trip.

0:23:52.298 --> 0:23:54.640
I'll come get you at
the inn, there.

0:23:54.901 --> 0:23:56.432
The White Bear.

0:24:04.058 --> 0:24:05.306
- Mowson!
- Present.

0:24:05.424 --> 0:24:06.709
- Briscoe!
- Present.

0:24:06.773 --> 0:24:07.776
- Maloney!
- Present.

0:24:07.820 --> 0:24:08.940
- Katch!
- Present.

0:24:09.150 --> 0:24:09.973
Larson ?

0:24:11.680 --> 0:24:12.426
Larson ?

0:24:12.725 --> 0:24:15.413
Captain, the second is wrapping
up the hull inspection.

0:24:15.488 --> 0:24:17.477
- It shouldn't take much—
- Present.

0:24:23.776 --> 0:24:25.312
- Frenchy!
- Present.

0:24:25.573 --> 0:24:26.954
Gentlemen, to your places!

0:24:27.024 --> 0:24:28.458
We're leaving in fifteen minutes.

0:24:28.533 --> 0:24:31.248
- That wasn't the plan—
- Larson, being my brother doesn't

0:24:31.240 --> 0:24:33.360
- exempt you from being on time.
- You should have told me!

0:24:33.408 --> 0:24:35.232
The weather is turning bad,
we need to go.

0:24:35.230 --> 0:24:38.032
- I was about to win big—
- No time for your scams!

0:24:38.101 --> 0:24:40.336
That boat is mine too, father
handed it down to—

0:24:40.330 --> 0:24:42.266
Do you think it's that easy?

0:24:42.690 --> 0:24:44.480
Be a good second, first.

0:24:45.056 --> 0:24:46.010
Anything else?

0:25:11.109 --> 0:25:11.930
Maid?

0:25:12.218 --> 0:25:13.962
Could you bring me a new lead?

0:25:16.352 --> 0:25:19.141
Sorry, miss, but there's no maid here,

0:25:19.140 --> 0:25:21.029
only a boss, and her name is Olga.

0:25:21.445 --> 0:25:23.146
I can't do anything about your lead,

0:25:23.140 --> 0:25:25.877
here we drink, eat, and that's all,
what can I get you?

0:25:26.608 --> 0:25:28.848
I'm waiting for the captain
of the Norge.

0:25:28.933 --> 0:25:31.365
I didn't know Lund had such
a young girlfriend!

0:25:31.472 --> 0:25:34.229
Lund? Isn't his name Larson?

0:25:34.325 --> 0:25:35.280
Larson?

0:25:35.477 --> 0:25:38.298
He's just the second, always
ready to brag.

0:25:38.405 --> 0:25:39.968
Where was he supposed
to bring you?

0:25:40.069 --> 0:25:41.354
The Franz Josef Land.

0:25:41.690 --> 0:25:43.685
And you managed to fell for that!

0:25:50.309 --> 0:25:53.850
- What's the matter with that bourgeoise?
- She's after Larson, from the Norge.

0:25:53.914 --> 0:25:56.869
The Norge is already gone, they left
about ten minutes ago.

0:26:15.514 --> 0:26:17.285
I think you forgot something.

0:26:18.650 --> 0:26:20.160
I packed up your maps.

0:26:20.832 --> 0:26:24.980
You shouldn't have too much regrets, Lund wouldn't
have taken a woman onboard anyway.

0:26:25.034 --> 0:26:26.314
It doesn't matter anymore.

0:26:27.024 --> 0:26:28.826
You'll see clearer tomorrow.

0:26:28.880 --> 0:26:31.722
- For now, you need to eat and sleep.
- But I don't have any money,

0:26:31.765 --> 0:26:33.296
Larson took everything.

0:26:34.420 --> 0:26:35.605
What about your parents?

0:26:35.717 --> 0:26:37.226
I can't ask them.

0:26:40.912 --> 0:26:43.642
I can provide you with food
and a place to sleep,

0:26:43.856 --> 0:26:46.672
- but you'll have to work!
- Work?

0:26:46.960 --> 0:26:49.808
Yes, at the inn, cleaning up, cooking...

0:26:49.909 --> 0:26:52.600
I'm guessing you never did all that,
by looking at your hands.

0:26:53.013 --> 0:26:54.362
Alright, can we go?

0:26:59.240 --> 0:27:01.093
What about your bag?

0:27:01.253 --> 0:27:03.552
Did you expect me to
carry it around?

0:27:12.608 --> 0:27:14.032
Wake up, princess!

0:27:15.205 --> 0:27:17.301
- It's still night!
- No, it's five.

0:27:17.402 --> 0:27:19.104
I have been awake for half an hour.

0:27:20.176 --> 0:27:22.906
- Could you pass me my dress?
- I found you that blouse.

0:27:23.002 --> 0:27:25.648
I'll keep your dress for now, I don't
want you running away.

0:27:25.780 --> 0:27:28.357
Cheer up, I've brought some pork kacha

0:27:28.437 --> 0:27:29.840
to start off the day.

0:27:31.152 --> 0:27:34.357
- Do you have blinis?
- Do you want some caviar, with those?

0:27:34.570 --> 0:27:36.197
I give you ten minutes.

0:27:41.258 --> 0:27:44.030
- Olga, did you forget me?
- Calm down, it's coming!

0:27:44.149 --> 0:27:47.402
- The Goloubsty is becoming impatient!
- Yes, I just finished preparing.

0:27:47.430 --> 0:27:49.066
- Did you do as I told you?
- Yes.

0:27:49.962 --> 0:27:52.565
I'm tired of cooking, couldn't I
serve the tables?

0:27:54.005 --> 0:27:57.605
- My housekeeper showed me!
- You know, they aren't blue bloods,

0:27:57.600 --> 0:28:00.293
- they don't know good manners.
- Good, that'll be easier!

0:28:00.906 --> 0:28:02.154
You're wrong.

0:28:03.157 --> 0:28:05.109
Go ahead, bring drinks
to the back table.

0:28:06.005 --> 0:28:06.848
Thanks!

0:28:14.256 --> 0:28:16.586
- What about my beans?
- They're coming!

0:28:17.370 --> 0:28:19.160
I've been waiting for
fifteen minutes!

0:28:19.205 --> 0:28:19.978
Yes, yes!

0:28:20.394 --> 0:28:21.860
- Here!
- I'm coming.

0:28:22.149 --> 0:28:23.952
I asked for a beer, not wine!

0:28:24.048 --> 0:28:26.677
Are you sure, don't you
want to taste it?

0:28:26.805 --> 0:28:29.488
- It's very good, you know.
- Then drink it yourself!

0:28:42.005 --> 0:28:43.754
Alright, you've worked enough.

0:28:44.554 --> 0:28:47.200
I honestly thought you wouldn't make it.

0:28:47.701 --> 0:28:49.200
Will you give me my dress back?

0:28:52.400 --> 0:28:54.250
So, what are you going to do?

0:28:54.512 --> 0:28:56.750
I'll get back home, in Saint Petersburg.

0:28:56.816 --> 0:29:00.602
With Mommy and Daddy? Some guy steals your
earrings, and you crawl back home?

0:29:00.800 --> 0:29:04.101
- I expected more from Oloukine's granddaughter.
- How do you know?

0:29:04.208 --> 0:29:05.402
The police is looking for you.

0:29:05.500 --> 0:29:08.453
They came here with a few questions,
but I've said nothing.

0:29:08.554 --> 0:29:10.901
I also know you want to find the Davaï.

0:29:11.904 --> 0:29:14.458
You shouldn't have left
your maps on that table!

0:29:14.554 --> 0:29:16.309
I couldn't help but take a look.

0:29:17.941 --> 0:29:20.501
You need to get on the Norge,
Larson owes you.

0:29:21.002 --> 0:29:24.501
Lund is a great sailor, you know,
he can get you to the Davaï.

0:29:24.752 --> 0:29:26.250
Those thirty days will fly by!

0:29:26.300 --> 0:29:29.104
With all the work I'll give you,
you won't get bored!

0:30:35.957 --> 0:30:36.800
Cheers!

0:31:07.800 --> 0:31:10.640
<i>We were pitching so much,
it was unbelievable!</i>

0:31:10.752 --> 0:31:12.005
<i>You, pitching a lot?</i>

0:31:35.077 --> 0:31:37.738
- The Norge! I didn't
expect you so early.

0:31:37.808 --> 0:31:40.304
The hunt was pretty bad,
we cut it short.

0:31:40.453 --> 0:31:42.752
I hope you still have
something for us, Olga!

0:31:43.104 --> 0:31:45.306
Don't worry about that. Where's Lund?

0:31:45.653 --> 0:31:48.901
- No idea.
- I bet you two got in an argument again.

0:31:49.002 --> 0:31:52.106
- As always, he didn't appreciate—
- Enough of that, Larson.

0:31:53.109 --> 0:31:54.202
Hello Olga.

0:32:05.200 --> 0:32:07.152
- They arrived.
- I've heard.

0:32:07.253 --> 0:32:08.800
I've prepared the glasses.

0:32:09.157 --> 0:32:11.557
I'll manage that, you go put
your pretty dress!

0:32:11.802 --> 0:32:12.720
My dress?

0:32:12.853 --> 0:32:14.650
You'll be more at ease
than in that rag.

0:32:16.053 --> 0:32:17.509
But I'm not ashamed of it.

0:32:18.501 --> 0:32:22.000
- Let me introduce you to Lund.
- No, you've helped me enough.

0:32:22.501 --> 0:32:26.000
- Plus he doesn't look like a monster.
- He has his character, be careful.

0:32:33.605 --> 0:32:34.757
Stop that!

0:32:36.000 --> 0:32:38.853
The Davaï sank, we can
at least display that!

0:32:40.069 --> 0:32:42.805
You're wrong, the Davaï
is unsinkable.

0:32:45.509 --> 0:32:49.104
Look, you're cute, but we spent
three months looking for that thing,

0:32:49.200 --> 0:32:50.805
so when we tell you it sank—

0:32:50.901 --> 0:32:54.000
- You were at the wrong spot.
- She's even going to find it for us.

0:32:54.101 --> 0:32:55.002
Yes I will.

0:32:55.152 --> 0:32:57.552
Why do you think we were
at the wrong spot?

0:32:58.100 --> 0:32:59.109
This,

0:32:59.220 --> 0:33:01.322
the itinerary that Oloukine followed.

0:33:02.106 --> 0:33:03.408
Where did you find this?

0:33:03.701 --> 0:33:06.282
I am Sasha Tchernetsov, his granddaughter.

0:33:06.805 --> 0:33:08.704
I found it in his room.

0:33:09.706 --> 0:33:13.280
Captain, Olga told me that you could
help me to find the Davaï.

0:33:15.130 --> 0:33:17.589
She's a brave girl,
please listen to her.

0:33:20.208 --> 0:33:22.917
So, if we take account of that data,

0:33:22.960 --> 0:33:25.605
we know that he did halt
in Novaya Zemlya.

0:33:25.856 --> 0:33:29.258
But then, instead of crossing the
Kara Sea as expected,

0:33:29.420 --> 0:33:32.202
he tried going West, by
the Barents Sea.

0:33:32.336 --> 0:33:35.253
And it's probably there, between
Franz Josef and the Spitsbergen,

0:33:35.354 --> 0:33:37.509
- that he got stuck in the ice.
- Alright.

0:33:37.720 --> 0:33:40.352
Let's admit that he
did write this thing.

0:33:40.602 --> 0:33:44.954
Let's admit that he did think about another
path, through the Barents Sea.

0:33:45.152 --> 0:33:47.860
- How can we know he actually took it?
- He had to!

0:33:47.936 --> 0:33:51.450
The climatic conditions of the Kara Sea
were awful, I've checked!

0:33:51.605 --> 0:33:54.154
The wind was blowing at force ten.

0:33:54.352 --> 0:33:56.704
I can assure you, the
Davaï didn't sink.

0:33:57.152 --> 0:34:00.752
He's waiting for you, just like the million
roubles that the Tsar promised!

0:34:01.754 --> 0:34:04.752
One million divided by ten, that's almost
one hundred thousand each!

0:34:04.858 --> 0:34:07.205
Quit dreaming, you're not the
one that will share it.

0:34:13.104 --> 0:34:15.600
Winter is coming, we'll be
leaving tomorrow.

0:34:16.250 --> 0:34:18.256
You'll only have to
wait a few weeks.

0:34:18.458 --> 0:34:20.784
- But I'm going with you!
- No way.

0:34:20.901 --> 0:34:22.656
But why? I can help you!

0:34:22.752 --> 0:34:25.402
I know everything about this
region, ask me anything, I—

0:34:25.504 --> 0:34:29.104
The surface area of the Kara Sea, three
hundred and fourty thousand square miles.

0:34:29.110 --> 0:34:32.610
- The latitude of the Spitsbergen—
- What about the age of the captain?

0:34:33.104 --> 0:34:34.458
Thirty eight and a half.

0:34:34.906 --> 0:34:36.304
I know everything.

0:34:36.453 --> 0:34:38.853
Mowson has a tattoo on the left buttock.

0:34:39.850 --> 0:34:42.757
Frenchy is an amazing cook
but a terrible singer.

0:34:42.922 --> 0:34:45.514
- And Briscoe—
- Don't waste your time.

0:34:45.600 --> 0:34:48.592
I've made my decision. Don't worry,
you'll have your share.

0:34:48.650 --> 0:34:50.709
I don't care about that
money, you can keep it.

0:34:50.858 --> 0:34:53.205
It's only about my family's honor.

0:34:54.453 --> 0:34:56.202
Plus, I've already paid for the trip,

0:34:56.357 --> 0:34:58.005
didn't I, <i>Captain</i> Larson?

0:34:59.258 --> 0:35:01.002
What's that about?

0:35:01.157 --> 0:35:03.536
Well, I—

0:35:03.605 --> 0:35:07.000
Oloukine gifted me with those
earrings, they had a lot of value.

0:35:07.402 --> 0:35:08.405
Give her back!

0:35:08.608 --> 0:35:10.208
I can't. I—

0:35:10.608 --> 0:35:12.400
Lost them gambling.

0:35:14.901 --> 0:35:17.104
Tomorrow. Four in the morning.

0:35:17.701 --> 0:35:19.056
Don't be late.

0:35:19.509 --> 0:35:20.805
All aboard!

0:35:27.504 --> 0:35:28.453
We did it.

0:35:30.309 --> 0:35:32.709
He's a man of honor, he had
to take you with him.

0:35:33.306 --> 0:35:34.800
But you might pay the price.

0:36:08.853 --> 0:36:09.830
Careful.

0:36:17.386 --> 0:36:18.805
- Sorry.
- Out of the way!

0:36:20.106 --> 0:36:23.002
Looks like Oloukine's granddaughter
doesn't have sea legs.

0:36:23.504 --> 0:36:25.002
Briscoe, take her downstairs!

0:36:28.496 --> 0:36:30.453
Here's your cabin, Princess.

0:36:30.853 --> 0:36:33.354
- Where are we?
- It's the quarantine cabin.

0:36:33.701 --> 0:36:35.808
Don't complain, it's our
only vacant bed.

0:37:22.880 --> 0:37:25.930
We're setting sails,
we're setting sails!

0:37:32.853 --> 0:37:36.192
- I put her in the quarantine cabin.
- Hopefully she'll stay there.

0:37:36.256 --> 0:37:38.064
Navy, are we headed for it?

0:37:38.202 --> 0:37:41.002
- You're sure?
- Yes captain, but the current is strong!

0:37:41.050 --> 0:37:42.154
Good.

0:38:01.056 --> 0:38:03.205
Hey, what are you doing here?

0:38:04.250 --> 0:38:06.106
Calm down, sit.

0:38:07.205 --> 0:38:08.154
Stop!

0:38:11.754 --> 0:38:14.752
Looks like you've found each
other. Meet Shakle.

0:38:14.805 --> 0:38:17.904
When he's not stealing, he's eating
the cordage, so he's grounded.

0:38:31.760 --> 0:38:32.930
Shakle!

0:38:40.138 --> 0:38:41.861
<i>Frenchy! Frenchy!</i>

0:38:41.930 --> 0:38:44.624
<i>Frenchy! Frenchy! Frenchy!</i>

0:38:53.168 --> 0:38:54.885
<i>Hello, my name's Frenchy,</i>

0:38:54.954 --> 0:38:56.757
<i>trust me, I make a pretty good gravy!</i>

0:39:06.901 --> 0:39:08.208
Did you eat something?

0:39:08.405 --> 0:39:10.154
Yes, in my cabin.

0:39:11.856 --> 0:39:13.317
You're sure you can talk to me?

0:39:14.906 --> 0:39:16.058
I do what I want.

0:39:16.250 --> 0:39:18.453
The view is better up there, you know.

0:39:19.480 --> 0:39:20.704
Are you scared?

0:39:25.280 --> 0:39:26.554
As you want!

0:39:52.800 --> 0:39:56.602
- You would be safer if you grabbed me.
- Just stop making everything move!

0:39:59.104 --> 0:40:01.653
The view is already pretty
good from here, I guess.

0:41:18.805 --> 0:41:20.352
Damn, you're fast!

0:41:20.506 --> 0:41:24.000
I thought your thing was sewing,
not potato peeling!

0:41:24.600 --> 0:41:26.250
Olga taught me.

0:41:26.608 --> 0:41:28.901
So you did work a month
at the White Bear?

0:41:30.608 --> 0:41:32.554
And I was taking you for a stuck-up!

0:42:03.306 --> 0:42:04.405
I need to go.

0:42:07.802 --> 0:42:09.301
You're forgetting this.

0:42:14.350 --> 0:42:17.130
Would you look at that
little playboy over here?

0:42:17.200 --> 0:42:20.842
Look at you! She's just way
above your league.

0:42:21.408 --> 0:42:23.600
Well at least I didn't scam her!

0:42:23.754 --> 0:42:25.301
- I know she likes me.
- Larson!

0:42:44.890 --> 0:42:46.453
Don't you have
something to do?

0:42:46.500 --> 0:42:48.704
- That girl is—
- Off her back.

0:42:52.900 --> 0:42:55.312
- This looks bad, let's change course.
- No.

0:42:58.202 --> 0:43:00.554
Everyone on the deck!

0:43:00.709 --> 0:43:02.405
Lower the sail!

0:43:15.002 --> 0:43:16.709
Drop the jibs!

0:43:17.306 --> 0:43:18.901
Drop the jibs!

0:43:30.896 --> 0:43:34.554
She must go in her cabin,
she can't stay here.

0:43:35.008 --> 0:43:37.200
- Captain's Orders!
- I'm fine!

0:43:37.258 --> 0:43:38.304
I risk nothing!

0:43:38.901 --> 0:43:39.900
Watch out!

0:43:43.456 --> 0:43:45.109
Careful, guys!

0:43:45.253 --> 0:43:47.669
Fasten that thing, damnit!

0:43:47.754 --> 0:43:49.152
Maloney, Briscoe!

0:43:49.306 --> 0:43:50.453
Up there, quick!

0:44:33.301 --> 0:44:35.658
- Come on, get up!
- What's happening?

0:44:35.706 --> 0:44:39.104
Two guys are injured, we need the cabin.
You'll sleep with the crew.

0:44:39.205 --> 0:44:41.658
You wanted to be a sailor,
right? There you go.

0:44:42.352 --> 0:44:44.757
I'm telling you, the only thing she'll

0:44:44.750 --> 0:44:46.906
achieve is causing us bad luck.

0:44:46.950 --> 0:44:50.458
- Didn't she help you, earlier?
- We would have made it without her.

0:44:54.202 --> 0:44:57.354
Hello. The second has
sent me here.

0:45:00.357 --> 0:45:02.858
Come in, your bed is right there.

0:45:18.506 --> 0:45:21.850
They don't smell amazing, but
they're really not mean.

0:46:30.058 --> 0:46:33.002
Katch, the ices, wake up!

0:46:48.858 --> 0:46:50.005
Look, Olouk.

0:46:50.202 --> 0:46:52.405
We made it.

0:46:53.180 --> 0:46:56.190
Ice field straight ahead!

0:46:57.008 --> 0:46:58.709
Everybody, get ready!

0:47:07.008 --> 0:47:09.700
Full ahead!

0:47:20.858 --> 0:47:23.653
Come on, push, push harder!

0:47:34.700 --> 0:47:37.109
Stop, we're running aground!

0:47:37.157 --> 0:47:38.400
Full astern!

0:47:38.853 --> 0:47:40.800
- Stop, stop!
- Stop!

0:47:53.354 --> 0:47:54.752
We must hurry!

0:47:57.205 --> 0:47:59.354
- Come on, guys.
- Catch this!

0:48:21.509 --> 0:48:24.101
No time for dreaming, get to work!

0:48:38.906 --> 0:48:40.500
The rudder is free!

0:48:44.920 --> 0:48:46.400
Everybody on board!

0:48:54.554 --> 0:48:55.952
Full ahead!

0:48:56.000 --> 0:48:57.301
Full ahead!

0:50:08.901 --> 0:50:10.053
Captain!

0:50:10.304 --> 0:50:12.400
A lifeboat to the port side!

0:50:16.906 --> 0:50:19.258
We can't see, I'll go
take a look.

0:50:19.301 --> 0:50:21.605
Captain, can I come with you?

0:50:21.904 --> 0:50:23.504
I know those lifeboats.

0:50:23.706 --> 0:50:25.306
Maloney, with me!

0:50:29.754 --> 0:50:30.805
Larson!

0:50:33.109 --> 0:50:34.800
This place is dangerous.

0:50:35.002 --> 0:50:37.706
If we're not back in an
hour, leave without us.

0:51:17.701 --> 0:51:19.200
Do you really want to come?

0:51:19.706 --> 0:51:21.706
It could be unpleasant.

0:51:36.757 --> 0:51:38.506
It's been there for at least a year.

0:51:39.957 --> 0:51:41.600
Did it belong to the Davaï?

0:51:41.706 --> 0:51:43.002
They capsized.

0:51:43.701 --> 0:51:44.752
I figured out.

0:51:45.408 --> 0:51:48.256
But you were right, the Davaï
did take that path.

0:51:48.453 --> 0:51:50.309
The fog is rising.

0:51:50.656 --> 0:51:51.701
Let's get back.

0:52:07.808 --> 0:52:10.000
They're taking too long.
How much time?

0:52:10.106 --> 0:52:11.306
Almost two hours.

0:52:15.557 --> 0:52:18.704
The hull can't take that much
longer, we need to move.

0:52:18.720 --> 0:52:20.352
We'll leave when I say so.

0:52:38.530 --> 0:52:39.952
There, look!

0:52:40.357 --> 0:52:41.354
There they are!

0:52:57.402 --> 0:52:58.485
Look out!

0:52:58.906 --> 0:53:00.453
Up there, damnit!

0:53:00.554 --> 0:53:02.202
- Move from there!
- What's he saying?

0:53:02.256 --> 0:53:03.104
Move!

0:53:03.456 --> 0:53:04.709
Move!

0:53:04.746 --> 0:53:05.909
Careful!

0:53:08.390 --> 0:53:09.680
Full ahead!

0:53:51.002 --> 0:53:53.450
- Damn, Sasha, get out of here!
- I'm coming!

0:53:55.200 --> 0:53:56.906
- I took the maps.
- Good.

0:53:57.109 --> 0:53:58.704
Now go help the others.

0:53:58.805 --> 0:54:01.104
- We have to get the sails out of that ice.
- Larson!

0:54:01.152 --> 0:54:02.501
Get the dynamite and come here.

0:54:06.256 --> 0:54:09.104
- I told you to leave.
- I couldn't let you die!

0:54:09.150 --> 0:54:11.157
- You'd have done the same thing!
- Don't dream!

0:54:11.205 --> 0:54:13.050
I'd never have sacrificed the boat.

0:54:13.109 --> 0:54:15.552
Look at the situation
you've put us in!

0:54:18.608 --> 0:54:20.058
Get to cover!

0:54:50.608 --> 0:54:51.605
Lund!

0:55:20.453 --> 0:55:21.610
Larson!

0:56:30.202 --> 0:56:31.002
So?

0:56:32.202 --> 0:56:33.904
He's badly injured.

0:56:34.101 --> 0:56:36.000
And we lost the penicillin.

0:56:36.704 --> 0:56:39.354
- I don't know what to do.
- We need to find the Davaï!

0:56:39.408 --> 0:56:41.104
We'll find medicine aboard.

0:56:44.458 --> 0:56:45.904
Larson, we need to talk.

0:56:48.954 --> 0:56:51.701
- We won't last a week.
- Cut the rations in half.

0:56:51.909 --> 0:56:52.928
Already done.

0:56:53.056 --> 0:56:55.402
Make it work. And keep
that for yourself.

0:56:59.354 --> 0:57:02.453
Our only solution is to get to
the Davaï by the land.

0:57:02.554 --> 0:57:03.402
Look.

0:57:03.605 --> 0:57:05.301
We found the lifeboat here.

0:57:05.808 --> 0:57:08.709
When they left the Davaï, they
probably went south.

0:57:09.104 --> 0:57:12.704
We should walk North from that point.

0:57:12.757 --> 0:57:14.250
We can't be sure.

0:57:14.506 --> 0:57:16.357
We should wait for another boat.

0:57:19.658 --> 0:57:20.853
We don't have time.

0:57:29.109 --> 0:57:32.112
- What do we do?
- We're done, we're all gonna die—

0:57:32.304 --> 0:57:33.354
Calm down!

0:57:33.754 --> 0:57:36.800
Listen, all. We have enough
food for two weeks.

0:57:37.205 --> 0:57:40.650
No boat will come around
here until next year.

0:57:41.056 --> 0:57:43.701
Staying here or going south,
it doesn't matter,

0:57:43.856 --> 0:57:46.005
we wouldn't make it
through winter.

0:57:46.101 --> 0:57:48.752
We have only one solution,
finding the Davaï.

0:57:48.850 --> 0:57:52.058
- Forget that damn boat!
- We found a lifeboat, it's probably close.

0:57:53.909 --> 0:57:55.557
I went through Oloukine's notes.

0:57:55.605 --> 0:57:58.250
Two years ago, the winter
lasted a long time.

0:57:58.357 --> 0:58:00.954
The Davaï is probably stuck
in the ice, North from here.

0:58:01.402 --> 0:58:05.050
No boat can withstand
that kind of pressure!

0:58:05.109 --> 0:58:06.554
It sank, like the Norge!

0:58:06.700 --> 0:58:08.800
- That thing sank!
- Listen!

0:58:08.906 --> 0:58:11.205
Its hull was designed to
withstand the ice!

0:58:11.306 --> 0:58:13.856
- Olou—
- Shut up! This is all your fault!

0:58:13.950 --> 0:58:16.602
- One more word and I swear—
- You swear what?

0:58:16.810 --> 0:58:17.957
This?

0:58:23.354 --> 0:58:24.805
My brother is right.

0:58:25.402 --> 0:58:28.058
The Davaï is our only solution.

0:58:31.600 --> 0:58:34.405
I'm fine, take care of them
rather than me.

0:58:36.357 --> 0:58:37.754
And protect her.

0:59:12.800 --> 0:59:17.189
Eighty-one degrees and six minutes,
it should be behind those mountains.

0:59:17.706 --> 0:59:19.104
It's a hummock.

0:59:19.152 --> 0:59:22.602
We don't have enough
food to make a detour,

0:59:22.704 --> 0:59:24.101
we'll have to climb.

0:59:24.430 --> 0:59:26.208
Let's keep going!

0:59:56.154 --> 0:59:57.258
Come on, come on!

0:59:57.504 --> 0:59:58.240
Good!

1:00:15.650 --> 1:00:16.250
Come on!

1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:27.301
Watch out!

1:00:29.104 --> 1:00:30.133
Captain!

1:00:31.749 --> 1:00:32.704
Captain!

1:00:35.952 --> 1:00:36.901
Captain.

1:00:47.205 --> 1:00:49.653
His wound reopened, he
needs some rest.

1:00:49.909 --> 1:00:50.704
Alright.

1:00:51.306 --> 1:00:52.821
We'll make camp here!

1:00:52.900 --> 1:00:53.802
No you won't!

1:00:54.101 --> 1:00:56.554
- What?
- We're already three days late.

1:00:56.954 --> 1:00:58.709
We're running out of food.

1:00:59.408 --> 1:01:01.653
If you want to find the Davaï,

1:01:02.506 --> 1:01:04.250
you need to leave right now.

1:01:04.304 --> 1:01:06.458
But we can't just leave you here!

1:01:06.608 --> 1:01:10.000
- You're the only one that can sail it!
- Larson will figure it out.

1:01:10.053 --> 1:01:11.754
You know I don't have
your knowledge!

1:01:11.754 --> 1:01:14.650
Enough, you should have already
been gone, it's an order!

1:01:15.354 --> 1:01:17.104
You ain't in no shape
to give orders!

1:01:18.106 --> 1:01:19.952
And now, am I more convincing?

1:01:20.309 --> 1:01:21.306
Leave him here!

1:01:21.408 --> 1:01:25.205
It's all his fault, a real captain wouldn't
have listened to that girl!

1:01:25.301 --> 1:01:28.704
That's true, we're all going
to die here because of him!

1:01:28.805 --> 1:01:30.752
They're right. Go away.

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.306
Move!

1:01:40.352 --> 1:01:42.325
Alright, we pack up and leave!

1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:45.301
We can't leave him here,
he's gonna die!

1:01:45.354 --> 1:01:47.605
- That's his problem.
- You jerk!

1:01:47.706 --> 1:01:48.954
I won't let you do that!

1:01:52.830 --> 1:01:53.830
Nicely done.

1:01:57.306 --> 1:01:58.901
Come on, let's move!

1:02:11.557 --> 1:02:13.504
He'll be dead in two days.

1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:17.909
- Sorry about what I said when—
- I'm the one that should apologize.

1:02:18.058 --> 1:02:19.402
About your earrings.

1:02:20.304 --> 1:02:22.506
I'm sorry, I really am.

1:02:52.053 --> 1:02:54.352
- Give me that!
- You got more than me!

1:02:54.421 --> 1:02:56.650
- You had your share!
- Yeah, sure!

1:02:56.805 --> 1:02:58.554
We always get less than you!

1:02:58.709 --> 1:03:01.456
Of course, Frenchy serves
his friends first!

1:03:23.408 --> 1:03:26.405
Katch, look, it's the summit!

1:03:46.704 --> 1:03:49.456
There's nothing! Where's the Davaï?

1:03:49.808 --> 1:03:50.740
Sasha?

1:03:53.802 --> 1:03:55.152
We need to get down!

1:03:55.354 --> 1:03:57.450
Quick, the blizzard is coming.

1:03:57.500 --> 1:04:00.357
I knew it, she has no idea
where we're going!

1:04:00.602 --> 1:04:02.202
We're all gonna die!

1:04:33.408 --> 1:04:34.709
- Move!
- You move!

1:04:35.808 --> 1:04:37.008
It's my turn!

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:47.002
That's all?

1:04:47.653 --> 1:04:49.557
And why does he have two plates?

1:04:50.405 --> 1:04:51.808
It's Sasha's.

1:04:51.829 --> 1:04:53.568
Even if she'll get all of us killed?

1:04:53.754 --> 1:04:55.050
Are you mad? Give me that!

1:04:55.205 --> 1:04:56.954
No, stop!

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:58.800
Give me that, I said!

1:05:01.194 --> 1:05:02.304
Stop!

1:05:03.104 --> 1:05:05.250
Damn kid, have you seen
what you've done?

1:05:06.208 --> 1:05:07.904
Don't you dare touch my food!

1:05:10.805 --> 1:05:12.208
Stop that, it's mine!

1:05:12.250 --> 1:05:14.906
- It's not yours, it's on the ground!
- Oh yeah? Take that!

1:05:14.954 --> 1:05:16.352
- Are you okay?
- Leave me!

1:05:16.458 --> 1:05:17.952
It's all your fault!

1:08:04.202 --> 1:08:05.701
"<i>To Sasha Tchernetsov</i>"

1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:20.608
Sasha!

1:09:21.904 --> 1:09:23.002
Sasha!

1:09:24.304 --> 1:09:25.360
Sasha!

1:09:26.005 --> 1:09:27.354
Sasha!

1:09:31.402 --> 1:09:35.002
Shakle, where's Sasha?
Bring me to her!

1:10:48.901 --> 1:10:49.754
Sasha!

1:11:11.354 --> 1:11:13.301
<i>Logbook, 13th April.</i>

1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:16.901
<i>The men have stopped obeying me.</i>

1:11:17.504 --> 1:11:20.101
<i>The winter ended up killing my authority.</i>

1:11:20.901 --> 1:11:23.904
<i>They refused to pursue the
exploration, and to move</i>

1:11:24.005 --> 1:11:27.200
<i>the provisions that would have
allowed our return any further.</i>

1:11:29.410 --> 1:11:30.990
<i>21st May.</i>

1:11:31.258 --> 1:11:34.000
<i>They embarked the lifeboats
and went South,</i>

1:11:34.458 --> 1:11:37.002
<i>hoping to cross the path of a whaler.</i>

1:11:38.752 --> 1:11:40.453
<i>Logbook, 2nd June.</i>

1:11:42.208 --> 1:11:45.605
<i>Despite everything, I decided to take my chance.</i>

1:11:46.453 --> 1:11:48.154
<i>I can't give up now.</i>

1:11:49.701 --> 1:11:51.408
<i>I leave my ship behind me.</i>

1:11:53.010 --> 1:11:58.480
<i>It will wait for me, at 87.2° 76.5°.</i>

1:12:00.053 --> 1:12:01.450
I know where the Davaï is!

1:12:48.940 --> 1:12:49.909
There's nothing!

1:12:50.053 --> 1:12:52.106
We should see it from here!

1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:53.410
Nothing, I tell you!

1:12:53.653 --> 1:12:55.002
<i>88.7°...</i>

1:12:55.830 --> 1:12:58.154
Wait a second, plus the ice drift,

1:12:59.056 --> 1:13:00.101
maybe...

1:14:47.310 --> 1:14:48.458
<i>25th July.</i>

1:14:50.554 --> 1:14:53.200
<i>I'm getting close, I can feel it.</i>

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:18.853
<i>2nd August.</i>

1:15:19.957 --> 1:15:21.200
<i>It's done.</i>

1:15:22.106 --> 1:15:23.306
<i>The Pole is mine.</i>

1:15:24.405 --> 1:15:26.501
<i>The hardest part is still to come.</i>

1:15:28.602 --> 1:15:30.005
<i>16th September.</i>

1:15:31.002 --> 1:15:33.408
<i>The blizzard has been raging for three days,</i>

1:15:33.552 --> 1:15:35.600
<i>and my strength is giving out.</i>

1:15:40.154 --> 1:15:41.402
<i>22nd October.</i>

1:15:42.752 --> 1:15:45.109
<i>My trip is coming to an end.</i>

1:15:46.005 --> 1:15:48.709
<i>I won't have the strength
to regain the Davaï.</i>

1:15:50.901 --> 1:15:53.002
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

1:15:53.710 --> 1:15:57.470
<i>I wish you could see that, my Sasha.</i>

1:16:25.605 --> 1:16:26.602
Come on!

1:16:27.157 --> 1:16:28.304
Pull!
