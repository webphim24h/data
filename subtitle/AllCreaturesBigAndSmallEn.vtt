WEBVTT

0:00:13.771 --> 0:00:15.485
<i>Of course.</i>

0:00:15.486 --> 0:00:18.342
<i>I need the drink warmer.
Okay. Ah..</i>

0:00:19.106 --> 0:00:23.987
<i>Where is that? Hmm, okay.
We put that, over there.</i>

0:00:24.045 --> 0:00:26.116
<i>Ahh. Map, map, map</i>

0:00:26.147 --> 0:00:28.957
<i>Finny, did you take the map?</i>

0:00:28.983 --> 0:00:30.223
And where's the flask?

0:00:30.985 --> 0:00:33.226
Oh, here it is. Never mind!

0:00:34.155 --> 0:00:36.157
Oh, do not forget this.

0:00:37.091 --> 0:00:38.235
Finny?

0:00:44.265 --> 0:00:46.108
Where is that boy?

0:00:46.167 --> 0:00:48.169
Dad, Dad!

0:00:51.239 --> 0:00:56.211
Something great happened, Dad!
I actually made friends today!

0:00:56.244 --> 0:01:01.950
We climbed a cactus, and threw rocks
into the canyon that was so deep,

0:01:02.016 --> 0:01:04.056
we couldn't even hear the land!

0:01:04.118 --> 0:01:05.153
It was great!

0:01:05.186 --> 0:01:08.030
Tomorrow we...

0:01:08.055 --> 0:01:10.057
Are you even listening, Dad?

0:01:10.057 --> 0:01:13.231
I... I'm sorry, Finny.

0:01:14.061 --> 0:01:16.063
No, not again!

0:01:17.198 --> 0:01:19.144
You've just finished the new house!

0:01:19.233 --> 0:01:20.974
I just made friends!

0:01:21.102 --> 0:01:22.979
It's different this time.

0:01:23.004 --> 0:01:26.178
All animals of the world
have been called to a gathering.

0:01:27.008 --> 0:01:28.112
Well, I'm staying here!

0:01:28.276 --> 0:01:30.019
No, listen.

0:01:30.111 --> 0:01:32.082
There is a flood coming, Finny.

0:01:32.179 --> 0:01:35.160
We'll drown if we don't leave.

0:01:37.051 --> 0:01:38.223
Water? Here?

0:01:43.991 --> 0:01:45.997
That's your lamest excuse ever!

0:01:46.060 --> 0:01:50.099
It's always the weather, or noisy neighbors,
or birds pooping on the...

0:01:54.101 --> 0:01:55.279
...porch.

0:01:56.003 --> 0:01:58.040
I know how you feel, Finny,

0:01:58.072 --> 0:02:00.143
But it's my job to keep you safe.

0:02:16.057 --> 0:02:17.161
Now.

0:02:18.025 --> 0:02:20.096
Where did I put that umbrella?

0:02:24.131 --> 0:02:26.111
Oh. Ready?

0:02:27.101 --> 0:02:28.171
Guess so.

0:02:32.039 --> 0:02:33.074
Come on.

0:02:33.240 --> 0:02:36.187
We got a long ways to go.

0:02:36.243 --> 0:02:38.154
We'll find our place.

0:02:55.262 --> 0:02:57.403
Are we there yet?

0:03:21.055 --> 0:03:23.194
- Woah!
- Woah!

0:03:23.991 --> 0:03:25.971
I think this is it.

0:03:36.971 --> 0:03:39.144
Looks like the flood
will be here soon.

0:03:40.007 --> 0:03:41.111
Calm down, Finny.

0:03:41.175 --> 0:03:45.146
They wouldn't make us come all this way
without some kind of a plan,

0:03:46.147 --> 0:03:47.525
Right?

0:04:00.261 --> 0:04:02.138
Good spot.

0:04:06.133 --> 0:04:08.044
- Hey.
- Quiet, please!

0:04:10.071 --> 0:04:11.209
Quiet!

0:04:15.976 --> 0:04:19.116
Behold!
The king of the animals!

0:04:27.221 --> 0:04:29.223
Ah, look at this fella, Finny.

0:04:29.256 --> 0:04:31.998
Everything will be fine.

0:04:32.059 --> 0:04:34.232
I'm afraid I have some
terrible news.

0:04:34.962 --> 0:04:36.942
Aah, I knew it!

0:04:36.964 --> 0:04:39.968
Dad, everybody's staring.

0:04:44.238 --> 0:04:50.154
But it gives me great hope to see
all you animals standing together as one.

0:04:52.079 --> 0:04:55.083
The fleshy doom carnivores.

0:04:55.116 --> 0:04:58.896
And the vegetarian herbs.

0:04:58.986 --> 0:05:02.991
In this together we will make our stand
against the upcoming events.

0:05:03.224 --> 0:05:07.129
You may have noticed that
the weather has been a little erratic lately.

0:05:07.228 --> 0:05:12.109
You may certainly have asked yourselves
what might happen next.

0:05:12.133 --> 0:05:14.010
A flood!

0:05:14.034 --> 0:05:20.007
So great that it can cover the earth,
engulfing and destroying everything in its path!

0:05:20.040 --> 0:05:23.888
- Oh, no!
- There shall be no survivors.

0:05:23.978 --> 0:05:27.983
Hey, mister, what's that
boat-shaped thing behind ya?

0:05:33.187 --> 0:05:36.031
Oh, yes, yes.
I was getting to that point.

0:05:36.991 --> 0:05:38.971
There wouldn't be any survivors

0:05:38.993 --> 0:05:41.997
if it wasn't for
a very nice human called Noah.

0:05:42.029 --> 0:05:45.067
- Noah?
- He's building a huge ark

0:05:45.099 --> 0:05:48.080
A ship to keep us animals safe
until the flood has passed.

0:05:49.270 --> 0:05:51.912
I told you they had a plan.

0:05:52.006 --> 0:05:54.145
I probably should've
started with that.

0:05:54.241 --> 0:06:00.214
Well, I, the king of the animals, has been
appointed captain of the ark by Noah himself.

0:06:01.048 --> 0:06:05.087
He put me in charge
of managing all animal affairs.

0:06:05.119 --> 0:06:08.066
So, Noah has some rules.

0:06:08.088 --> 0:06:13.003
First of all, there is a ban
on carnivores eating herbivores.

0:06:13.027 --> 0:06:14.097
What?

0:06:14.995 --> 0:06:15.999
I should think so too.

0:06:16.096 --> 0:06:19.236
He seems pretty serious
about that.

0:06:19.236 --> 0:06:20.034
Sadly.

0:06:20.034 --> 0:06:23.015
- Hey, let them go!
- Uh, excuse me!

0:06:23.037 --> 0:06:24.072
Yes?

0:06:24.104 --> 0:06:28.143
Does that ban start now,
or when we board the ship?

0:06:28.976 --> 0:06:30.956
The ban starts now.

0:06:31.111 --> 0:06:33.250
See? I told you.

0:06:37.251 --> 0:06:43.067
And?

0:06:46.126 --> 0:06:49.198
And, finally, all animals
are welcome on the ark.

0:06:51.065 --> 0:06:52.976
Yes!

0:06:53.000 --> 0:06:56.072
As long as you are on Noah's list.

0:06:56.103 --> 0:07:00.051
- What did he say?
- See you tomorrow at the check-in.

0:07:00.975 --> 0:07:03.979
List? What list?

0:07:22.196 --> 0:07:23.939
Next.

0:07:24.031 --> 0:07:25.237
Good day!

0:07:27.968 --> 0:07:34.078
- Now, who do we have here?
- We're songbirds, from Australia!

0:07:38.145 --> 0:07:41.083
Well, then you're on the list.
Welcome aboard.

0:07:41.181 --> 0:07:45.061
Sign here, please!

0:07:45.085 --> 0:07:49.033
Thank you, you've checked in.
Have a nice trip!

0:07:49.156 --> 0:07:53.070
- Next.
- We are tigers from Siberia.

0:07:55.162 --> 0:07:57.233
Welcome aboard.

0:07:57.264 --> 0:07:59.940
- Next.
- Oh, that's me! Coming, coming now.

0:08:00.034 --> 0:08:02.981
Left foot, middle foot,
right foot, left...

0:08:03.003 --> 0:08:07.008
Ah, focus, Tanglefoot!
Focus! Come on!

0:08:07.074 --> 0:08:08.246
Hi, I'm a Tanglefoot!

0:08:08.976 --> 0:08:11.081
- Next.
- Ah, here we go.

0:08:11.111 --> 0:08:14.925
- We are elephants.
- From India or Africa?

0:08:15.015 --> 0:08:18.087
- Huh? Are you kidding?
- Huh?

0:08:18.218 --> 0:08:19.219
You're checked in.

0:08:19.219 --> 0:08:22.996
Next. Welcome aboard. Next.

0:08:23.190 --> 0:08:25.966
Welcome on the ark. Next.

0:08:25.993 --> 0:08:29.099
Next... next... next...

0:08:31.065 --> 0:08:32.243
Next.

0:08:34.969 --> 0:08:36.142
Hey.

0:08:40.174 --> 0:08:42.211
Hello, I'm Dave.

0:08:42.977 --> 0:08:44.251
I'm a Nestrian.

0:08:44.979 --> 0:08:46.049
Nestrian?

0:08:46.080 --> 0:08:49.052
That rings a bell.
Where are you from?

0:08:49.149 --> 0:08:52.028
Ah, uh, actually, sir,
we don't really know!

0:08:53.120 --> 0:08:56.192
We gotta travel the world
looking for a place to stay.

0:08:56.991 --> 0:09:01.167
Wait a second. Aren't you the fellow
that riffle blue gas

0:09:01.195 --> 0:09:05.007
- when you get scared?
- Oh, you've heard of us?

0:09:05.032 --> 0:09:08.141
- I'm sure we're gonna have a great trip!
- I'm sorry, next.

0:09:08.235 --> 0:09:11.216
What? No, this must be
a mistake!

0:09:11.271 --> 0:09:15.017
If you're not on the list,
you're not on the ark.

0:09:15.109 --> 0:09:17.214
Now, please.

0:09:17.244 --> 0:09:19.986
Don't send us away.

0:09:20.014 --> 0:09:21.994
We can be of great use to you.

0:09:22.116 --> 0:09:23.194
It's a long trip, right?

0:09:23.250 --> 0:09:26.993
We can make things
nice and cozy for all of you.

0:09:27.021 --> 0:09:30.095
Nestrians are great
home makers!

0:09:30.190 --> 0:09:34.095
I can even make a place
like this look good.

0:09:34.194 --> 0:09:38.165
- Margaret lives here.
- I think we've wasted enough time.

0:09:38.232 --> 0:09:41.213
No, you can't do this!

0:09:44.004 --> 0:09:46.942
You're not going to let some
over sensitive, cave-dwelling,

0:09:47.041 --> 0:09:51.990
paper-pushing, crazy woman called
"Margaret" tells us what to do!

0:09:52.012 --> 0:09:53.016
Right?

0:09:53.113 --> 0:10:00.190
We're all guys here, huh?

0:10:00.220 --> 0:10:03.201
- I'm Margaret.
- Aah!

0:10:06.194 --> 0:10:08.969
- Aah! Nestrians!
- Aah!

0:10:10.197 --> 0:10:12.074
Get out of here!

0:10:18.138 --> 0:10:20.982
Thank goodness we're on the ark!

0:10:26.080 --> 0:10:29.027
Oh, hey, Dad!

0:10:30.117 --> 0:10:31.118
Hey.

0:10:31.151 --> 0:10:33.222
Leah?

0:10:35.189 --> 0:10:37.191
- Well?
- Well what?

0:10:37.191 --> 0:10:40.001
We are Grymps.

0:10:43.230 --> 0:10:45.107
Of course we're on board.

0:10:47.067 --> 0:10:48.137
What are you doing?

0:10:48.168 --> 0:10:51.140
Oh, sorry, Mom. I forgot myself.

0:10:51.238 --> 0:10:55.150
You, young lady, have a lot to learn
about being a Grymp.

0:10:55.209 --> 0:10:58.022
- Now, come on.
- Yes, mom.

0:10:58.112 --> 0:11:01.992
So, Dad, how did it go?

0:11:02.015 --> 0:11:03.119
Never have gone better.

0:11:03.150 --> 0:11:05.087
Really? Excellent!

0:11:05.185 --> 0:11:09.133
- We're gonna be on the ark! Hep-hep Horey!
- Uh, come on, son. Come on. Let's go.

0:11:09.189 --> 0:11:11.226
Did you see
those cool-looking black cats?

0:11:11.258 --> 0:11:16.071
I think they're called Grymps, right?
Maybe we will meet them again on board.

0:11:34.014 --> 0:11:38.053
Do you think all the animals of the world
will be on there with us?

0:11:38.085 --> 0:11:40.966
Uh, well, it is
a pretty big boat, you know.

0:11:41.054 --> 0:11:42.900
Hm, could you pass me the rope?

0:11:42.990 --> 0:11:45.197
Oh, sure.

0:11:45.225 --> 0:11:47.969
And will there be bears and elephants?

0:11:49.096 --> 0:11:50.976
The door, please?

0:11:51.064 --> 0:11:54.045
That's gonna be so awesome.

0:11:54.067 --> 0:11:55.913
Yeah, sure.

0:11:56.003 --> 0:11:57.007
Uh, dad?

0:11:57.104 --> 0:12:00.984
Uh, you know,
this place turned out pretty well.

0:12:01.141 --> 0:12:03.246
Almost ashamed to leave, isn't it?

0:12:03.277 --> 0:12:08.022
- What are you talking...
- I mean, we could stay here if you like

0:12:08.081 --> 0:12:13.121
- Maybe this time you can even make..
- Dad, we didn't get on the ark, did we?

0:12:17.991 --> 0:12:20.895
I'm sorry, Finny,
we are not on the list.

0:12:20.994 --> 0:12:23.975
Ah, I knew they'd turn us away!

0:12:24.031 --> 0:12:25.101
Nestrians!

0:12:25.199 --> 0:12:28.180
- We just don't fit in.
- Don't say that.

0:12:28.201 --> 0:12:29.978
I'll find us a home.

0:12:30.070 --> 0:12:33.051
A place where you'll make friends.

0:12:34.007 --> 0:12:37.181
Finny, look at me.

0:12:38.111 --> 0:12:41.058
I'll get us on the ark, okay?

0:12:41.982 --> 0:12:43.586
You mean it?

0:12:43.984 --> 0:12:45.224
I give you my word.

0:13:11.011 --> 0:13:12.015
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

0:13:12.112 --> 0:13:16.185
<i>Do not forget to show your boarding passes
and print it on your boots.</i>

0:13:16.249 --> 0:13:17.127
Thank you.

0:13:17.217 --> 0:13:22.064
Okay, straight ahead.
Enjoy your trip.

0:13:22.089 --> 0:13:24.091
Welcome aboard.

0:13:24.124 --> 0:13:28.129
Zebras...
Level 2, cabin 743.

0:13:28.195 --> 0:13:31.267
Have a nice trip!

0:13:31.965 --> 0:13:34.104
- Next!
- Sure.

0:13:34.134 --> 0:13:36.080
Hey, don't cut in the line.

0:13:36.103 --> 0:13:41.985
Sorry, guys, we're in a hurry. It's the
Griffins. Check the list, if you can read.

0:13:42.009 --> 0:13:44.148
- Help!
- Huh?

0:13:44.177 --> 0:13:47.021
Get me out!

0:13:49.082 --> 0:13:54.031
The bad breath is killing me!
Get me out of here!

0:13:54.054 --> 0:13:56.127
Hey, spit him out!
You know the rules!

0:13:56.223 --> 0:14:00.069
Can't you pull yourself
together for once?

0:14:01.094 --> 0:14:05.133
I didn't come here all the way
from Kansas to get eaten.

0:14:05.165 --> 0:14:08.103
Oh, you look so tasty.

0:14:08.201 --> 0:14:12.013
You guys scram
before things get ugly.

0:14:12.039 --> 0:14:18.012
No offense, mate. But, uh
You're a gorilla. Things are already ugly.

0:14:18.045 --> 0:14:20.116
You asked for it.

0:14:26.019 --> 0:14:29.990
You really think this is
gonna work?

0:14:30.090 --> 0:14:32.263
We'll get on the ark.

0:14:32.993 --> 0:14:35.098
You'll see.

0:14:35.128 --> 0:14:38.200
<i>Please do not leave your baggage
unattended or it may be eaten.</i>

0:14:38.231 --> 0:14:41.940
Do you think we'll be
the only Grymps on board?

0:14:41.969 --> 0:14:43.004
Why do you ask?

0:14:43.036 --> 0:14:45.175
I just thought it might be nice
to have some company.

0:14:45.205 --> 0:14:48.052
Company? Grymps don't do company.

0:14:48.141 --> 0:14:51.122
The only way to survive
is to look out for ourselves.

0:14:51.144 --> 0:14:53.124
- How many times do I have to...
- Hey, nice highlights!

0:14:53.146 --> 0:14:56.118
Ooh, nice highlights!

0:14:56.216 --> 0:14:58.196
Would you mind what you do
with that thing?

0:14:58.218 --> 0:15:01.097
- Grymps coming through!
- Grrr!

0:15:03.124 --> 0:15:06.229
- Uh-oh!
- Is that some sort of joke?

0:15:06.259 --> 0:15:09.138
Darling, there you are.
Ha-ha!

0:15:09.162 --> 0:15:09.940
What's the rush?

0:15:10.030 --> 0:15:13.111
You really think you're gonna
get away with this?

0:15:13.166 --> 0:15:16.045
Not so loud.

0:15:16.103 --> 0:15:17.138
Pretty good, huh?

0:15:17.170 --> 0:15:21.050
- You think I look like that?
- It was his idea!

0:15:21.074 --> 0:15:23.987
I'm going to tell the guards
what you are trying to pull.

0:15:24.010 --> 0:15:26.151
- Good day to you, sir.
- Don't touch me.

0:15:26.246 --> 0:15:31.083
- We are Grymps. He-he.
- He's a liar!

0:15:31.084 --> 0:15:34.031
Oh, boy.

0:15:37.057 --> 0:15:40.061
Okay, straight ahead.

0:15:40.093 --> 0:15:42.164
Don't believe a word
this thing is saying.

0:15:42.195 --> 0:15:46.143
Hey, go work out your family
issues in your cabin.

0:15:46.166 --> 0:15:50.979
- This isn't my husband!
- You are not the only ones who want aboard.

0:15:51.004 --> 0:15:55.009
- But I...
- Another word, you're off.

0:15:55.041 --> 0:15:56.987
Next!

0:15:57.010 --> 0:16:00.915
This way, Mr. and Mrs. Grymp.

0:16:01.014 --> 0:16:03.187
See? Told you we'll get
on the ark.

0:16:03.216 --> 0:16:05.992
Yeah!

0:16:12.025 --> 0:16:16.030
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain speaking.</i>

0:16:16.062 --> 0:16:18.966
<i>Please proceed to your cabins
with the initial boarding process.</i>

0:16:19.065 --> 0:16:23.104
<i>Our sailing time will be
approximately 40 days and 40 nights.</i>

0:16:23.136 --> 0:16:26.083
<i>We're expecting some
choppy seas and light drizzles.</i>

0:16:26.106 --> 0:16:27.050
<i>Thank you.</i>

0:16:27.073 --> 0:16:29.144
Hey, get off!
This is our cabin!

0:16:29.176 --> 0:16:31.019
Coming through.

0:16:31.044 --> 0:16:32.216
<i>Ha! Check this out!</i>

0:16:32.245 --> 0:16:34.921
Good! Ocean view!

0:16:35.015 --> 0:16:38.963
<i>May I also remind you that this is
a non-carnivores voyage.</i>

0:16:38.985 --> 0:16:40.987
<i>Thank you for
your understanding.</i>

0:16:41.021 --> 0:16:44.002
<i>I could really gulp some
giraffes right about now</i>

0:16:44.024 --> 0:16:46.095
<i>Captain, you're still on air!</i>

0:16:46.126 --> 0:16:47.903
<i>Whoops!</i>

0:16:47.994 --> 0:16:49.965
Thanks for playing along.

0:16:50.063 --> 0:16:51.533
You've saved our lives.

0:16:52.232 --> 0:16:58.012
Grymps don't save lives.
We take 'em.

0:17:02.142 --> 0:17:05.021
Love you too.

0:17:06.079 --> 0:17:09.051
May I present your deluxe cabin.

0:17:09.149 --> 0:17:14.030
Including of exclusive ocean view
and king sized Haystock

0:17:14.054 --> 0:17:16.091
for your charming family.

0:17:16.122 --> 0:17:18.159
This isn't my husband.

0:17:18.191 --> 0:17:20.137
Throw him off this ark!

0:17:20.160 --> 0:17:22.037
Come on, darling.

0:17:22.062 --> 0:17:25.343
We'll make this place home
in no time.

0:17:28.101 --> 0:17:33.175
If I may be so direct,
you two make a rather endearing couple.

0:17:35.108 --> 0:17:38.954
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

0:17:38.979 --> 0:17:41.084
Cool! Count me in!

0:17:44.184 --> 0:17:47.131
Hey, I'm Finny.

0:17:48.121 --> 0:17:52.001
You know, I bet everyone thinks
we're brother and sister.

0:17:52.025 --> 0:17:54.030
I'm not looking for
a little sister.

0:17:54.127 --> 0:17:56.129
What? No!

0:17:56.163 --> 0:17:59.042
You'd be the little sister.

0:17:59.166 --> 0:18:01.942
And I'd be the...

0:18:02.002 --> 0:18:04.004
Hey.

0:18:05.071 --> 0:18:06.882
What are we doing here?

0:18:06.973 --> 0:18:10.182
I wanna see the flood
with my own eyes.

0:18:18.084 --> 0:18:19.961
You might've hurt somebody.

0:18:19.986 --> 0:18:21.226
"You might've hurt somebody."

0:18:21.254 --> 0:18:25.225
Run back to daddy
if you're scared.

0:18:27.227 --> 0:18:32.142
<i>For your own safety, please do not leave
cabin during our voyage.</i>

0:18:32.165 --> 0:18:36.045
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

0:18:39.206 --> 0:18:42.050
I knew there was no flood.

0:18:44.077 --> 0:18:46.079
I don't think we're
allowed up here.

0:18:46.112 --> 0:18:50.060
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- Huh?

0:18:50.083 --> 0:18:52.222
- Doesn't look like you have one.
- I sure do.

0:18:52.252 --> 0:18:54.994
- Hey!
- Huh!? Whoa!

0:18:55.121 --> 0:18:58.000
You kids ain't allowed up there!

0:19:08.201 --> 0:19:10.181
Phew, that was...

0:19:10.203 --> 0:19:13.116
Hmm, where'd they go?

0:19:21.014 --> 0:19:22.994
<i>Get your tail in.</i>

0:19:23.016 --> 0:19:25.123
Ah, sorry.

0:19:25.218 --> 0:19:26.993
- Ha!
- Aah!

0:19:27.053 --> 0:19:30.034
Hey, stop!
Come back here!

0:19:40.100 --> 0:19:42.139
You kids are in big trouble!

0:19:42.235 --> 0:19:46.980
Maybe if we start crying,
he'll feel bad and let us go.

0:19:47.007 --> 0:19:49.180
You can do whatever you like.
I am a Grymp.

0:19:49.209 --> 0:19:52.088
We don't show fear.

0:19:52.112 --> 0:19:55.218
You don't scare me!
Grawh!

0:19:57.984 --> 0:20:00.055
Yeah, you better run!

0:20:00.086 --> 0:20:02.999
Wow, that was awesome.

0:20:03.023 --> 0:20:06.004
Did you see
the look on his face?

0:20:06.026 --> 0:20:10.031
Yeah! That's the look.

0:20:15.201 --> 0:20:17.181
The flood!

0:20:17.203 --> 0:20:19.149
What do we do? What do we do?
What do we do?

0:20:19.172 --> 0:20:21.882
Relax, we're on an ark.

0:20:21.975 --> 0:20:23.977
Right, this is the ark.

0:20:24.044 --> 0:20:26.183
What am I worried about?

0:20:26.212 --> 0:20:28.058
- This isn't the ark.
- What?

0:20:28.148 --> 0:20:31.960
This isn't the ark!

0:20:38.124 --> 0:20:40.070
Leah, come inside.

0:20:42.062 --> 0:20:44.042
Hold on, Finny!

0:20:44.064 --> 0:20:45.941
Finny?

0:20:45.999 --> 0:20:47.879
Oh, no! The ark!

0:20:47.967 --> 0:20:51.039
Hey, stop!

0:20:55.041 --> 0:20:56.213
Stop!

0:20:56.242 --> 0:20:59.951
- Don't go without us!
- Wait!

0:21:01.014 --> 0:21:02.049
Wait!

0:21:02.082 --> 0:21:04.062
Hey!

0:21:04.084 --> 0:21:05.222
Wait!

0:21:10.223 --> 0:21:13.932
Don't... stop...

0:21:14.995 --> 0:21:18.067
- Hey!
- Hey!

0:21:18.098 --> 0:21:19.975
No!

0:21:19.999 --> 0:21:23.173
Don't leave without us.

0:21:24.104 --> 0:21:27.950
No!

0:21:32.045 --> 0:21:35.959
- You can swim, right?
- I don't know, never been in the water!

0:21:35.982 --> 0:21:39.088
Time to find out!

0:21:41.254 --> 0:21:44.030
Aah...

0:21:44.057 --> 0:21:46.037
Huh?

0:21:46.059 --> 0:21:49.099
Look, they're bringing us
back to the ark.

0:21:49.195 --> 0:21:51.937
- Thanks for helping us!
- Ha-ha-ha!

0:21:51.965 --> 0:21:53.103
You're welcome.

0:21:54.968 --> 0:21:58.108
Hey, hey, you! What are you doing?
This is the wrong way.

0:21:58.138 --> 0:22:01.051
They're definitely not helping us.

0:22:01.074 --> 0:22:04.078
We're helping ourselves
we need a flight snack.

0:22:09.015 --> 0:22:11.086
- Huh!
- You're next! Ha-ha-ha!

0:22:12.185 --> 0:22:16.133
Oh no, don't tell me
you've got Grymp-ed again.

0:22:40.079 --> 0:22:41.183
What the heck was that?

0:22:41.214 --> 0:22:44.926
How many times do I have to
tell ya? Eat slowly.

0:22:45.018 --> 0:22:47.020
Oh, but I'm so hungry!

0:22:47.053 --> 0:22:49.934
Great, they were the only
food left!

0:22:50.023 --> 0:22:52.060
Whatever you did, it worked.

0:22:52.125 --> 0:22:54.062
Dad, Dad!

0:22:54.160 --> 0:22:56.231
Dad!

0:22:56.262 --> 0:23:01.075
Oh, no! They're leaving
without us!

0:23:01.234 --> 0:23:03.111
What are we gonna do?

0:23:03.136 --> 0:23:06.083
The flood, it will be here soon!

0:23:06.106 --> 0:23:09.144
I don't know about you
but I'm gonna keep moving.

0:23:15.215 --> 0:23:16.990
Children?

0:23:17.050 --> 0:23:18.256
What children?

0:23:18.985 --> 0:23:21.022
Leah!

0:23:21.054 --> 0:23:22.260
Finny?

0:23:22.956 --> 0:23:24.128
Oh!

0:23:24.157 --> 0:23:27.161
- Where's my daughter?
- Ack!

0:23:27.193 --> 0:23:30.174
- Thanks, guys.
- No worries.

0:23:30.196 --> 0:23:32.198
Leah?

0:23:33.099 --> 0:23:35.912
Finny?

0:23:36.002 --> 0:23:37.174
Uh-huh, uh-huh?

0:23:37.203 --> 0:23:39.205
No, she did not!

0:23:39.239 --> 0:23:41.947
Ugh, does it know where
the kids are or not?

0:23:41.975 --> 0:23:44.012
Shh!

0:23:44.978 --> 0:23:46.218
No.

0:23:46.246 --> 0:23:48.226
- Finny?
- Leah!

0:23:48.248 --> 0:23:51.058
Finny?

0:23:51.084 --> 0:23:52.188
- Finny?
- Leah?

0:23:52.218 --> 0:23:54.095
- Finny!
- Leah!

0:23:54.120 --> 0:23:56.157
Finny!

0:24:00.159 --> 0:24:03.231
Where are you?

0:24:10.103 --> 0:24:13.016
You probably don't know this.

0:24:13.039 --> 0:24:17.112
but running away
is a Nestrian's specialty.

0:24:17.143 --> 0:24:21.148
Dad and I just can't seem to sit still.

0:24:21.180 --> 0:24:27.091
Although, that's all
I want to do right now.

0:24:30.223 --> 0:24:32.134
I think we're high enough.

0:24:34.160 --> 0:24:37.141
We should make
a shelter for the night.

0:24:38.198 --> 0:24:39.975
What's all this "we" stuff?

0:24:40.066 --> 0:24:43.070
I told you to get lost already.

0:24:43.136 --> 0:24:46.950
I'm a Grymp.
We're loners.

0:24:47.040 --> 0:24:50.044
Are you sure?
Nestrians are great company.

0:24:50.076 --> 0:24:52.181
and we build pretty good shelters.

0:24:52.211 --> 0:24:58.184
Forget it, we'll make our own shelters
and go our seperate ways in the morning.

0:26:09.022 --> 0:26:10.228
Oh, please.

0:26:26.139 --> 0:26:29.985
Just a minute!
I'm in the bath!

0:26:34.981 --> 0:26:36.961
Hmm... Oh, hi!

0:26:36.983 --> 0:26:40.021
How nice of you to drop by.

0:26:40.987 --> 0:26:43.968
You're glowing.

0:26:43.990 --> 0:26:46.231
Oh, thanks.

0:26:46.259 --> 0:26:48.205
Oh, right.

0:26:48.227 --> 0:26:50.969
It happens in the dark.
Comes in handy when you're...

0:26:50.997 --> 0:26:53.978
Bad idea.
Light attracts enemies.

0:26:54.000 --> 0:26:55.138
Can't you switch it off?

0:26:55.168 --> 0:26:57.981
Nope, but do come inside.

0:26:58.071 --> 0:27:00.142
We're safe here, um...?

0:27:00.173 --> 0:27:01.151
Ugh, Leah.

0:27:01.174 --> 0:27:02.209
I'm Finny.

0:27:02.241 --> 0:27:05.154
Did i mention Nestrians
are great huggers?

0:27:05.178 --> 0:27:09.217
Somebody looks like
she could use a hug.

0:27:09.248 --> 0:27:12.229
Don't even think about it.

0:27:22.095 --> 0:27:24.132
You like?

0:27:24.163 --> 0:27:28.009
What a waste of effort
for just one night, huh.

0:27:28.034 --> 0:27:29.104
Nah, it's nothin'.

0:27:29.135 --> 0:27:31.206
I can build a house anytime
I want to.

0:27:31.237 --> 0:27:34.983
Nestrians don't stay in one place
for long anyways.

0:27:35.074 --> 0:27:36.075
That's weird.

0:27:36.109 --> 0:27:39.022
Dad says we have to
"Find our place" or whatever.

0:27:39.045 --> 0:27:41.949
Which totally sucks
when you want to make...

0:27:42.048 --> 0:27:45.120
You know, friends.

0:27:45.151 --> 0:27:48.223
I'll stay here tonight,
but that's it.

0:27:48.254 --> 0:27:51.963
Tomorrow morning, I'm out of here.
On my own.

0:28:03.202 --> 0:28:06.140
I guess the lion was right
about the flood.

0:28:06.239 --> 0:28:08.016
Yeah.

0:28:08.107 --> 0:28:11.247
But we're safe here for the night.

0:28:13.179 --> 0:28:17.059
And our parents will definitely come
and get us in the morning.

0:28:18.251 --> 0:28:21.232
I wonder if my mother
even knows I'm missing.

0:28:21.254 --> 0:28:24.235
Of course she does.

0:28:26.993 --> 0:28:30.065
But my dad,
he must be worried sick!

0:28:38.171 --> 0:28:39.982
I don't remember eating that.

0:28:40.072 --> 0:28:43.886
I've told that girl a million times
not to leave my sight.

0:28:43.976 --> 0:28:49.050
I have a bad feeling about this.

0:28:51.083 --> 0:28:54.897
- What?
- I believe, I have found your children.

0:28:54.987 --> 0:28:56.161
I knew it.

0:28:56.255 --> 0:28:59.964
Come on now, chop chop.

0:29:01.160 --> 0:29:03.006
Those aren't our kids!

0:29:03.095 --> 0:29:06.235
- Are you quite sure?
- Of course we're sure!

0:29:06.265 --> 0:29:09.041
Those are hippos!

0:29:10.002 --> 0:29:12.004
Do we look like hippos?

0:29:12.038 --> 0:29:14.075
Well,

0:29:14.173 --> 0:29:16.110
- Yes.
- What?

0:29:16.209 --> 0:29:19.147
I didn't get on this ark to be insulted.

0:29:19.245 --> 0:29:25.218
Do you know what a Grymp
is capable of when he gets angry?

0:29:31.123 --> 0:29:35.128
Eh, I think
I'm gonna be sick again.

0:29:38.998 --> 0:29:40.878
Get in there, you stowaways!

0:29:40.967 --> 0:29:42.071
This is a mistake!

0:29:42.101 --> 0:29:43.947
What seems to be the problem?

0:29:44.036 --> 0:29:45.174
This better be important.

0:29:45.204 --> 0:29:47.275
I'm getting my mane done.

0:29:47.974 --> 0:29:49.976
Finally, somebody reasonable.

0:29:50.009 --> 0:29:52.116
Captain, you've got to turn the ship around.

0:29:52.211 --> 0:29:56.890
I'm in charge here, and I will not turn
this ship around for anyone.

0:29:56.983 --> 0:29:57.918
But captain...

0:29:58.017 --> 0:30:00.019
Lock up these stowaways.
I'll deal with them later.

0:30:00.052 --> 0:30:02.225
What, no, no,
I'm not a stowaway!

0:30:02.255 --> 0:30:04.166
He dragged me into this.

0:30:04.190 --> 0:30:07.103
Now, you and your hubbie
can sort it out, hmm?

0:30:07.126 --> 0:30:09.939
No! Our kids are
drowning out there.

0:30:10.029 --> 0:30:12.009
And we're locked up in here.

0:30:12.031 --> 0:30:15.205
This is all your fault!

0:30:17.003 --> 0:30:19.975
I'm as worried about the children
as you are.

0:30:20.072 --> 0:30:26.250
But if we want to get out of here,
we have to work together.

0:30:31.217 --> 0:30:34.198
You'd better think of a way
out of here fast.

0:30:34.220 --> 0:30:37.997
Because I am getting hungry.

0:30:49.035 --> 0:30:51.015
What the...?

0:30:51.037 --> 0:30:53.017
Where is the forest?

0:30:54.207 --> 0:30:56.949
What are you doing?

0:30:57.009 --> 0:30:59.990
I'm building my own ark.

0:31:00.213 --> 0:31:02.889
Now I know what you're thinking.

0:31:02.982 --> 0:31:05.087
Where's the bed, right?

0:31:06.085 --> 0:31:11.034
How about sleeping in a
comfy hammock?

0:31:11.223 --> 0:31:13.032
That's pretty good.

0:31:13.059 --> 0:31:17.166
See, and you thought
you'd be better off without me.

0:31:24.236 --> 0:31:26.113
Oops.

0:31:33.045 --> 0:31:36.049
Oh, crying isn't gonna help.

0:31:36.082 --> 0:31:37.086
I'm not crying.

0:31:37.183 --> 0:31:39.993
Well, you should be.

0:31:40.019 --> 0:31:44.024
Wait! if you're not crying,
what's that noise?

0:31:46.992 --> 0:31:48.972
Those flying bats are back!

0:31:48.995 --> 0:31:50.932
We have to get away from here!

0:31:51.030 --> 0:31:54.068
There! Dry land!

0:31:54.100 --> 0:31:57.206
Hey, check out the clumsy bloke.

0:32:00.006 --> 0:32:02.247
Easy prey, ey?

0:32:03.142 --> 0:32:04.985
Leah!

0:32:05.011 --> 0:32:05.981
I can't!

0:32:06.078 --> 0:32:07.216
Ugh!

0:32:15.187 --> 0:32:18.100
Whoa!

0:32:21.994 --> 0:32:24.235
Ripe for the picking!

0:32:25.164 --> 0:32:28.077
- Aah!
- Get off me!

0:32:28.267 --> 0:32:31.214
Oh, I hate Grymps!

0:32:31.237 --> 0:32:33.048
Whoa, whoa!

0:32:33.139 --> 0:32:35.176
Whoa!

0:32:46.952 --> 0:32:47.225
Hi!

0:32:47.253 --> 0:32:49.164
- Ready?
- Nope.

0:32:52.224 --> 0:32:55.068
Thanks, Leah, that was..

0:32:55.261 --> 0:32:57.141
No more playing around!

0:32:57.229 --> 0:33:00.073
Yeah, time for breakfast.

0:33:10.009 --> 0:33:11.980
I'm so sorry!

0:33:12.077 --> 0:33:16.992
It can't be helped
when someone tickles my nostrils.

0:33:17.149 --> 0:33:18.119
Bless you!

0:33:18.217 --> 0:33:20.063
Thanks.

0:33:20.152 --> 0:33:24.000
Oh, oh, the water, it's here already!

0:33:24.090 --> 0:33:27.071
It's even worse than I thought.

0:33:27.093 --> 0:33:28.197
Who is that?

0:33:28.227 --> 0:33:30.903
A giant tortoise?

0:33:30.996 --> 0:33:33.135
Don't know, but it's helping them.

0:33:33.165 --> 0:33:35.909
Looks like we got to come up with..

0:33:36.001 --> 0:33:38.174
something else.

0:33:43.209 --> 0:33:45.089
Thanks for helping us.

0:33:45.177 --> 0:33:47.088
I'm Finny.

0:33:47.112 --> 0:33:49.149
And this is Leah.

0:33:50.049 --> 0:33:52.996
Uh, she's um..
She's not much of a talker.

0:33:54.120 --> 0:33:55.997
My name is Obesey.

0:33:56.021 --> 0:33:58.226
<i>Are you talking to yourself again?</i>

0:34:01.193 --> 0:34:03.173
- Hmm?
- Hi.

0:34:03.195 --> 0:34:04.870
Hi!

0:34:04.964 --> 0:34:07.137
Why aren't you kids on the ark?

0:34:07.166 --> 0:34:09.910
Are you rejects too?

0:34:10.002 --> 0:34:13.074
He's the reject. Not me.

0:34:13.205 --> 0:34:16.882
Our presence on the ark wasn't welcome either.

0:34:16.976 --> 0:34:22.187
Hey, speak for yourself Fatso! That stupid
Flamingo just messed up my paper work.

0:34:23.149 --> 0:34:24.926
I'm sorry about him.

0:34:25.017 --> 0:34:28.988
Stuck himself to me
two years ago but it won't get off.

0:34:29.021 --> 0:34:30.056
My name's Stayput.

0:34:30.089 --> 0:34:32.091
I'm Obesey's best friend.

0:34:32.091 --> 0:34:34.970
You are so annoying.

0:34:34.994 --> 0:34:37.201
We joke like this all the time.

0:34:37.229 --> 0:34:43.942
Now I have to share my last moments
with a constant ridge chattering back sit driver.

0:34:49.175 --> 0:34:51.919
Hey, why don't you guys
come with us?

0:34:52.011 --> 0:34:52.981
What?

0:34:53.079 --> 0:34:57.928
Oh, most kind of human, but I'm afraid
we'll just slow you down.

0:34:58.017 --> 0:35:00.190
Zip, Fatso! Don't listen to him!

0:35:00.219 --> 0:35:02.221
We'd love to come with you!

0:35:02.221 --> 0:35:04.965
But where to, exactly?

0:35:05.057 --> 0:35:07.128
Hmm..

0:35:07.193 --> 0:35:08.968
High up.

0:35:08.994 --> 0:35:11.065
Away from the flood.

0:35:12.064 --> 0:35:14.203
Good idea!

0:35:15.000 --> 0:35:17.002
Look at him.

0:35:18.070 --> 0:35:19.040
Hmm?

0:35:19.138 --> 0:35:21.917
How is he supposed to get up there?

0:35:22.007 --> 0:35:24.146
Come on, Leah,
they've saved us.

0:35:24.176 --> 0:35:27.157
We can't just leave them
here to drown.

0:35:27.179 --> 0:35:31.127
Ugh! Fine, but they're
your responsibility!

0:35:33.119 --> 0:35:35.030
Welcome to the team!

0:35:35.054 --> 0:35:36.126
Really?

0:35:36.222 --> 0:35:38.033
We can come with you?

0:35:38.124 --> 0:35:41.230
Great! See how things go
when I do the talking?

0:35:41.260 --> 0:35:44.036
Let's go!

0:35:45.064 --> 0:35:48.136
Ugh, I don't believe this.

0:36:15.060 --> 0:36:20.169
That, That's how it'll go down
like a ton of bricks. Ha-ha-ha!

0:36:29.141 --> 0:36:31.212
Do you hear that?

0:36:31.243 --> 0:36:33.120
What?

0:36:33.145 --> 0:36:36.092
Its dead silence.

0:36:36.115 --> 0:36:37.116
What do you expect?

0:36:37.116 --> 0:36:39.221
We're the only ones left.

0:36:42.221 --> 0:36:44.931
Not the only ones.

0:36:45.024 --> 0:36:46.196
Relax.

0:36:46.225 --> 0:36:47.900
We're a team now.

0:36:47.993 --> 0:36:49.028
We're safe.

0:36:49.061 --> 0:36:54.033
Well, then we don't have anything
to worry about, do we?

0:36:54.066 --> 0:36:56.068
Exactly!

0:36:58.103 --> 0:37:00.140
Head ups down there,
gratchy pants.

0:37:00.172 --> 0:37:02.982
Let's keep it moving!

0:37:05.110 --> 0:37:07.889
It's really cool that
you decide to come with us.

0:37:07.980 --> 0:37:09.186
We're all going the same way.

0:37:09.215 --> 0:37:10.958
What choice do I have?

0:37:11.050 --> 0:37:13.988
Come on, you gotta admit it.
We make a great team.

0:37:14.086 --> 0:37:17.033
Stop calling us a team!

0:37:17.122 --> 0:37:19.124
Oh, you are so right.

0:37:19.124 --> 0:37:21.104
We totally need a team name.

0:37:22.261 --> 0:37:25.105
How about The Flood Runners?

0:37:25.130 --> 0:37:27.010
Or The Fearsome Four?

0:37:27.099 --> 0:37:29.010
Or Master of the Mountains?

0:37:29.034 --> 0:37:31.207
Shut up!

0:37:33.973 --> 0:37:36.954
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't do that
If I were you.

0:37:37.176 --> 0:37:39.952
We're below the water line.

0:37:40.179 --> 0:37:42.090
Let's think for a minute.

0:37:42.114 --> 0:37:46.119
If we want to get out of here,
we need a well thought out plan.

0:37:46.151 --> 0:37:48.097
Hmm?

0:37:51.123 --> 0:37:53.060
Oh, that's it!

0:37:53.158 --> 0:37:54.136
Okay! Okay, okay!

0:37:54.159 --> 0:37:57.905
So, we're here, in the brick.

0:37:57.997 --> 0:38:00.102
Where's the captain?

0:38:01.066 --> 0:38:03.046
Right! Up in the bridge.

0:38:03.068 --> 0:38:06.242
So, we'll ask the guards
to let us out.

0:38:07.973 --> 0:38:11.011
Then we go through this corridor

0:38:11.043 --> 0:38:13.023
Up to the bridge.

0:38:13.078 --> 0:38:15.251
We reason with the captain.

0:38:17.082 --> 0:38:20.029
He will turn the ship around.

0:38:20.185 --> 0:38:22.222
and we'll all get the kids.

0:38:24.223 --> 0:38:27.127
No, there's no reasoning
with the guard or the lion.

0:38:27.226 --> 0:38:30.869
- Oh.
- I have a real plan.

0:38:30.963 --> 0:38:33.967
I'll fight my way
through the corridor.

0:38:33.999 --> 0:38:35.037
Take that.

0:38:35.134 --> 0:38:40.174
Then I take out the captain.

0:38:50.049 --> 0:38:51.929
Oh, wow, great plan.

0:38:52.017 --> 0:38:55.089
But didn't you forget that
we're still locked up in here?

0:38:56.989 --> 0:38:57.228
Darn it.

0:38:57.256 --> 0:38:59.964
How are we gonna get out?

0:38:59.992 --> 0:39:03.166
Ah, didn't you say
you were hungry?

0:39:04.954 --> 0:39:08.254
<i>Help!</i>

0:39:09.234 --> 0:39:11.145
<i>You come back here!</i>

0:39:11.170 --> 0:39:13.172
<i>Aah, somebody come in here!</i>

0:39:15.107 --> 0:39:17.178
Oh, boy.

0:39:25.050 --> 0:39:27.121
Huh?

0:39:27.219 --> 0:39:29.028
Stop! No hunting on the ark.

0:39:29.054 --> 0:39:33.960
What idiot puts a herbivore
and a carnivore in the same cell?

0:39:34.059 --> 0:39:38.201
I'm sorry, sir, that must have been
someone from the boarding ship pa...

0:39:45.104 --> 0:39:48.051
Hey! You can't...

0:39:48.106 --> 0:39:51.110
Wow, that was close!

0:39:51.210 --> 0:39:55.158
A little uh, a little
too exciting for my taste.

0:39:56.148 --> 0:39:58.150
Your plan worked.

0:39:58.150 --> 0:39:59.993
You make good bait.

0:40:00.018 --> 0:40:00.962
Oh, really?

0:40:00.986 --> 0:40:02.160
<i>Hey, let me out!</i>

0:40:02.254 --> 0:40:04.930
Which way?
We don't have much time.

0:40:05.023 --> 0:40:06.195
<i>I don't like it in here.</i>

0:40:06.225 --> 0:40:07.226
Uh, let me think.

0:40:07.226 --> 0:40:10.105
<i>I'll be your best friend
if you let me out.</i>

0:40:10.129 --> 0:40:14.009
Uh, um. This way?

0:40:21.039 --> 0:40:23.010
Someone's coming! Aah!

0:40:25.110 --> 0:40:27.112
Oh, no.

0:40:27.146 --> 0:40:29.126
What the...?

0:40:31.083 --> 0:40:33.156
<i>Oh, hey, guys,
come on, let me out!</i>

0:40:33.252 --> 0:40:37.200
<i>Come on! Please, let me out!
You can't do this.</i>

0:40:38.223 --> 0:40:39.898
Thanks!

0:40:39.992 --> 0:40:41.000
What happened?

0:40:41.020 --> 0:40:41.030
The stowaways, they got out.
What happened?

0:40:41.070 --> 0:40:42.227
The stowaways, they got out.

0:40:42.227 --> 0:40:45.208
They tricked me,
and I didn't see it coming.

0:40:45.230 --> 0:40:50.009
She pretended that she was hunting him,
so I went in to stop her,

0:40:50.035 --> 0:40:53.175
and I said,
"Hey, No hunting on the ark!"

0:40:53.205 --> 0:40:55.048
I knew they were trouble.

0:40:55.073 --> 0:40:57.075
Are you okay, sweetie?

0:40:57.209 --> 0:40:59.055
I'm okay.

0:40:59.144 --> 0:41:02.023
If I get my hands on those skanks,

0:41:02.247 --> 0:41:05.057
They're gonna pay for the...

0:41:12.191 --> 0:41:16.139
- Uh... Huh?
- Huh?

0:41:16.161 --> 0:41:18.974
- Let's get them!
- Let's go get them, sweetie!

0:41:19.064 --> 0:41:21.044
- I'm sorry, the gas...
- Sssh!

0:41:21.066 --> 0:41:22.946
I'm going up to level 4.

0:41:23.035 --> 0:41:27.108
Sometimes, it happens
when we get really, you know

0:41:27.139 --> 0:41:28.109
scared.

0:41:28.207 --> 0:41:32.212
How do you survive a single day?

0:41:32.978 --> 0:41:35.151
Now shut up and read the map.

0:41:35.247 --> 0:41:38.091
Up that ladder.

0:41:39.118 --> 0:41:42.099
And then it's uh... Wha!

0:41:42.988 --> 0:41:45.127
Children, please, wait!

0:41:51.263 --> 0:41:54.005
Turn left!

0:41:55.033 --> 0:41:57.206
Other left.

0:41:59.204 --> 0:42:02.083
Through that door on
the next floor.

0:42:08.113 --> 0:42:11.151
Uh, up the stairs, to the bridge!

0:42:16.188 --> 0:42:21.103
- You have reached your destination.
- Ssh, quiet!

0:42:22.400 --> 0:42:25.657
I hope there's a doctor on board.

0:42:30.135 --> 0:42:32.740
Maybe I should try to talk
to him again, it's...

0:42:32.971 --> 0:42:34.143
No! No more talking.

0:42:34.172 --> 0:42:37.153
I'll do this my way,
the Grymp way.

0:42:37.209 --> 0:42:39.086
You just stay here.

0:42:39.144 --> 0:42:41.124
Don't do anything.

0:42:41.146 --> 0:42:46.255
Could you manage that?
Or is that too much to ask of a Nestrian.

0:42:53.058 --> 0:42:54.002
Captain!

0:42:54.026 --> 0:42:55.096
<i>Come in!</i>

0:42:57.229 --> 0:43:01.075
Hi! How are you, uh, doing?

0:43:01.099 --> 0:43:05.013
I was wondering
if I could have a word with you?

0:43:05.037 --> 0:43:06.175
You again?

0:43:06.238 --> 0:43:09.151
My, you're a persistent
little creature.

0:43:13.045 --> 0:43:16.026
Your Highness, we...

0:43:20.052 --> 0:43:22.191
I have a big problem.

0:43:22.220 --> 0:43:24.166
Our kids are out there.

0:43:24.189 --> 0:43:26.520
Captain, you have to turn
the ship around.

0:43:26.992 --> 0:43:28.972
I believe we discussed
that issue.

0:43:29.027 --> 0:43:30.199
But sir, please.

0:43:30.228 --> 0:43:34.973
You're really starting to
get on my last nerve.

0:43:35.000 --> 0:43:37.039
But my son.

0:43:37.135 --> 0:43:39.115
He's all I have.

0:43:39.137 --> 0:43:43.108
I see, I'm not going to
get rid of you that easily.

0:43:43.141 --> 0:43:50.025
I suppose I could make an exception to the
troops between herbivores and carnivores!

0:43:53.151 --> 0:43:55.956
I didn't think
anyone will miss a little...

0:43:57.122 --> 0:43:59.124
Nestrian.

0:43:59.991 --> 0:44:03.165
I told you,
there's no talking to this guy.

0:44:03.195 --> 0:44:04.230
You know what?

0:44:04.963 --> 0:44:06.965
We make a great team.

0:44:16.041 --> 0:44:18.988
Let's find our children.

0:44:32.023 --> 0:44:34.094
That's where they have got to be.

0:44:54.079 --> 0:44:56.059
Candle-light dinner.

0:44:57.115 --> 0:44:58.992
Just the two of us.

0:44:59.017 --> 0:45:01.122
Oh yes, darling.

0:45:01.153 --> 0:45:03.224
We haven't done this in ages.

0:45:13.065 --> 0:45:14.000
Whoa.

0:45:14.099 --> 0:45:17.171
That sure is a long way down.

0:45:17.202 --> 0:45:18.977
Maybe there's another way.

0:45:19.004 --> 0:45:19.974
Forget it!

0:45:20.071 --> 0:45:23.018
We can't afford to waste
anymore time on detours.

0:45:23.041 --> 0:45:27.183
You've already spent half a day
making that stupid hat for Obesey.

0:45:29.181 --> 0:45:31.024
But he needed some shade.

0:45:31.049 --> 0:45:33.120
I told you he would slow us down.

0:45:33.151 --> 0:45:36.030
My fellow mountaineers.

0:45:36.087 --> 0:45:39.059
Might we stop for a quick break?

0:45:39.157 --> 0:45:42.969
There is no time for breaks, look!

0:45:57.142 --> 0:46:00.248
Well, I guess
it's the bridge then.

0:46:01.046 --> 0:46:03.219
Okay, I'm going ahead.

0:46:11.957 --> 0:46:15.131
You need to go slowly,
and one by one.

0:46:15.193 --> 0:46:18.106
Keep a good distance between each other.

0:46:18.196 --> 0:46:22.042
Some of these rocks are very loose.

0:46:22.167 --> 0:46:24.078
So wait for my word.

0:46:24.102 --> 0:46:26.048
And then...

0:46:26.171 --> 0:46:28.117
And then what?

0:46:31.109 --> 0:46:33.214
You gotta be kidding me!

0:46:35.213 --> 0:46:37.090
Dinner's coming.

0:47:07.078 --> 0:47:09.058
Obesey, check it out!

0:47:09.080 --> 0:47:12.152
You're a giant bumblebee!

0:47:13.084 --> 0:47:14.222
Hey, where's Leah?

0:47:14.252 --> 0:47:17.961
Don't worry, she's fine.

0:47:17.989 --> 0:47:18.959
Right, Leah?

0:47:19.057 --> 0:47:20.229
Never been better.

0:47:20.258 --> 0:47:22.900
Up, up and away, Captain!

0:47:22.994 --> 0:47:25.031
Aye-aye!

0:47:27.065 --> 0:47:31.070
At this rate, we'll
reach the top in no time.

0:47:31.136 --> 0:47:32.945
What are you doing?

0:47:33.004 --> 0:47:35.075
Get us down now.

0:47:35.974 --> 0:47:37.954
Wow!

0:47:38.043 --> 0:47:41.115
We will soon have reached
our cruising altitude.

0:47:45.016 --> 0:47:46.154
Oh no!

0:48:09.074 --> 0:48:11.953
Oh, oh my.

0:48:11.977 --> 0:48:12.978
I need to lie down.

0:48:13.011 --> 0:48:16.015
You are always lying down.

0:48:16.247 --> 0:48:18.889
- Leah?
- I knew it!

0:48:18.984 --> 0:48:20.122
Are you okay?

0:48:20.151 --> 0:48:22.097
I knew this would happen!

0:48:22.153 --> 0:48:26.158
Look! Up there!
It leads straight to the top!

0:48:30.228 --> 0:48:31.869
Oh, yeah!

0:48:31.963 --> 0:48:34.000
Even you can get up there, big guy.

0:48:34.032 --> 0:48:36.205
Yeah, we are the best team ever.

0:48:36.234 --> 0:48:37.975
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

0:48:38.003 --> 0:48:39.143
I'm going on by myself.

0:48:39.237 --> 0:48:42.946
- What?
- The whole team thing, it's not for me.

0:48:42.974 --> 0:48:44.214
But we've come so far.

0:48:44.242 --> 0:48:46.918
Far?
I shouldn't even be here.

0:48:47.012 --> 0:48:49.117
I'm supposed to be in the ark
with my mom.

0:48:49.147 --> 0:48:51.991
And it's your fault that I'm not.

0:48:52.050 --> 0:48:52.994
But Leah..

0:48:53.018 --> 0:48:54.190
Where are you gonna go?

0:48:54.219 --> 0:48:57.029
It is safer to stay with us.

0:48:57.055 --> 0:48:58.159
I'm going on alone.

0:48:58.190 --> 0:49:02.229
I don't need advice
from an over-grown slug.

0:49:02.961 --> 0:49:06.033
Wait, I think
I know what will fix this.

0:49:06.264 --> 0:49:10.041
Someone needs a hug!

0:49:10.969 --> 0:49:13.142
I'm done. Goodbye.

0:49:19.177 --> 0:49:23.091
But I thought we were a team.

0:49:23.114 --> 0:49:25.094
What do we do now?

0:49:25.984 --> 0:49:32.060
If the offer for a hug is still on the table,
I think I can do with one.

0:49:42.133 --> 0:49:46.172
<i>Captain, Lion! we got a security-breach
type situation.</i>

0:49:46.204 --> 0:49:47.082
The guards!

0:49:47.172 --> 0:49:49.015
I'll take care of him.

0:49:49.040 --> 0:49:50.110
Wait a second.

0:50:03.154 --> 0:50:06.226
<i>Come in, what are you
waiting for?</i>

0:50:08.226 --> 0:50:09.967
Sir!

0:50:11.996 --> 0:50:14.101
What seems to be the problem?

0:50:14.132 --> 0:50:18.947
Uh, a Nestrian and a Grymp
escape from the brick, sir.

0:50:19.037 --> 0:50:24.077
What idiot would let a Nestrian escape?

0:50:24.080 --> 0:50:25.100
Well, sir.

0:50:25.110 --> 0:50:28.990
Go and get them before
they cause a mutiny.

0:50:32.250 --> 0:50:38.032
Don't just stand there.
The entire animal kingdom is at stake.

0:50:38.123 --> 0:50:40.160
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!

0:50:44.160 --> 0:50:46.742
We're not gonna be able to
keep this up for much longer.

0:50:46.965 --> 0:50:50.071
We've got to find Leah and Finny soon.

0:50:50.101 --> 0:50:51.171
We will.

0:50:51.202 --> 0:50:54.012
Uh, I mean, we will.

0:51:00.211 --> 0:51:02.088
Grymps are loners.

0:51:03.014 --> 0:51:04.960
Grymps are loners.

0:51:07.018 --> 0:51:09.089
Grymps don't show fear.

0:51:10.054 --> 0:51:13.058
Grymps don't show fear.

0:51:21.066 --> 0:51:25.014
Uh, why did I just listen to mom
from the start?

0:51:25.036 --> 0:51:28.210
Grymps don't flock,
herd or swarm.

0:51:28.239 --> 0:51:30.981
We do not make friends.

0:51:31.009 --> 0:51:33.114
Ah, Leah, get a grip!

0:51:40.251 --> 0:51:42.060
Mom!

0:51:44.055 --> 0:51:45.966
Finny!

0:51:50.063 --> 0:51:53.940
- <i>Grab on to my tongue!</i>
- What?

0:51:53.965 --> 0:51:56.206
I said grab on to my tongue!

0:52:06.077 --> 0:52:08.023
Ah, you save me!

0:52:08.079 --> 0:52:10.059
Oh, that was nothing,
don't mention it.

0:52:10.081 --> 0:52:11.953
Well, you know,
I'm not going to boast with that,

0:52:11.983 --> 0:52:14.020
I was part of a rescue team too.

0:52:14.052 --> 0:52:16.054
But, what I said.

0:52:16.087 --> 0:52:18.124
I forgive you, sweetie.

0:52:18.189 --> 0:52:21.102
And actually, it was his idea.

0:52:21.125 --> 0:52:22.203
Heh?

0:52:23.028 --> 0:52:26.032
I just thought
I'd get the team back together.

0:52:27.065 --> 0:52:30.046
Go team, Flood Runners!

0:52:30.101 --> 0:52:34.072
Uh, wait a second. I thought
we went with "Masters of the Mountain?

0:52:34.072 --> 0:52:38.179
Didn't we decide on team
"Slow but steady"?

0:52:38.242 --> 0:52:41.155
I actually like
"The Fearsome Four".

0:52:41.179 --> 0:52:43.056
Agree!

0:53:02.133 --> 0:53:04.135
Come on, guys! We're on a roll.

0:53:04.169 --> 0:53:06.046
It shouldn't take too long until
we reach the...

0:53:14.212 --> 0:53:16.089
Oh, boy!

0:53:16.114 --> 0:53:19.095
So Leah, still happy
we saved you?

0:53:19.984 --> 0:53:22.055
I mean, good to have you back.

0:53:22.086 --> 0:53:25.192
Don't mind me.
I'm a babbler. Carry on.

0:53:32.096 --> 0:53:35.236
Hey, watch where you're going,
dosy eyes.

0:53:42.040 --> 0:53:44.020
So dark.

0:53:44.208 --> 0:53:47.121
Anybody got a torch?

0:53:50.048 --> 0:53:52.050
Wow!

0:53:56.220 --> 0:53:58.097
This isn't so bad.

0:53:58.122 --> 0:53:59.100
Finny?

0:53:59.190 --> 0:54:01.033
Are you there?

0:54:03.062 --> 0:54:05.939
- Ouch!
- I'm here.

0:54:06.130 --> 0:54:08.041
Hey, check it out!

0:54:08.966 --> 0:54:10.070
Ta da!

0:54:11.236 --> 0:54:13.944
Now, why can't I do
something like that?

0:54:13.972 --> 0:54:18.045
Because you are parasite,
and not a grow worm.

0:54:18.142 --> 0:54:19.985
Follow me.

0:54:20.011 --> 0:54:21.217
I'll light the way.

0:54:22.213 --> 0:54:25.057
Oh yeah, I'm a parasite.

0:54:25.083 --> 0:54:27.996
And you turned out
to be quite the host.

0:54:28.119 --> 0:54:32.158
Just because I love onions
doesn't mean I like the neighborhood.

0:54:44.035 --> 0:54:45.173
Are you okay?

0:54:45.203 --> 0:54:48.184
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

0:54:51.976 --> 0:54:55.981
Finny, Obesey needs a break.

0:54:57.148 --> 0:54:59.219
No problem.

0:55:06.157 --> 0:55:10.128
This looks like a good place
to make camp for the night.

0:55:10.161 --> 0:55:11.231
Here?

0:55:12.030 --> 0:55:14.032
Come on guys, give me a hint.

0:55:14.065 --> 0:55:17.171
Trust me,
he knows what he's doing.

0:55:26.144 --> 0:55:30.092
You Nestrians sure know
how to make things cozy, don't ya?

0:55:30.114 --> 0:55:31.991
You bet.

0:55:34.018 --> 0:55:36.157
We should reach the peak
in the morning.

0:55:36.187 --> 0:55:38.064
But the flood.

0:55:40.158 --> 0:55:42.968
It seems unstoppable.

0:55:43.995 --> 0:55:47.272
Maybe we're not destined to survive.

0:55:47.966 --> 0:55:49.206
Have you thought about that?

0:55:51.135 --> 0:55:54.981
All my life,
people have been making fun of me,

0:55:55.006 --> 0:55:57.077
saying I was good for nothing.

0:55:58.209 --> 0:56:01.019
I never fitted in anywhere.

0:56:01.078 --> 0:56:04.025
Now they don't even want me
on the ark.

0:56:05.049 --> 0:56:06.119
I'm just...

0:56:06.150 --> 0:56:07.151
Fat?

0:56:07.151 --> 0:56:08.994
No!

0:56:09.053 --> 0:56:10.864
Doomed!

0:56:10.955 --> 0:56:13.094
Don't say that!
We can't give up now.

0:56:13.124 --> 0:56:17.095
We'll have a rest, and then we'll head
for the peak, and signal for the ark.

0:56:17.128 --> 0:56:20.066
Yeah, come on, big guy.
Relax a little.

0:56:20.164 --> 0:56:22.044
We got a long way to go.

0:56:22.133 --> 0:56:24.113
I got a long way to go.

0:56:31.142 --> 0:56:33.179
You're just sitting up there.

0:56:49.260 --> 0:56:53.037
Come on! I'm getting seasick
in my sleep here.

0:56:53.064 --> 0:56:57.071
Sorry. The ground's
so hard as a rock.

0:56:57.168 --> 0:57:01.048
Maybe that's because
it is a rock. huh?

0:57:15.987 --> 0:57:19.025
I told you
he knows what he's doing.

0:57:19.991 --> 0:57:21.197
No doubt.

0:57:22.059 --> 0:57:24.164
Don't stop, Obesey.

0:57:25.029 --> 0:57:27.009
Keep on going.

0:57:27.198 --> 0:57:30.008
Okay.

0:57:32.103 --> 0:57:35.983
Good night, everyone.

0:57:39.010 --> 0:57:41.047
Night, Finny.

0:57:52.056 --> 0:57:57.005
You know, we're doing alright here.
They can't be far.

0:57:58.996 --> 0:58:01.272
I wonder if they're still
alive at all.

0:58:04.035 --> 0:58:08.941
I've always been so hard on her.
Trying to prepare her for life.

0:58:09.040 --> 0:58:09.975
You know?

0:58:10.074 --> 0:58:12.145
Make her tough.

0:58:12.176 --> 0:58:14.122
And now,

0:58:26.057 --> 0:58:27.903
Hey.

0:58:27.992 --> 0:58:31.166
I'd promised my son that
I'd get him on the ark.

0:58:31.195 --> 0:58:34.074
and I'm gonna keep my word.

0:58:34.132 --> 0:58:37.136
I just know Leah is with him.

0:58:38.069 --> 0:58:40.071
You, um...

0:58:41.038 --> 0:58:43.109
You glow.

0:58:43.975 --> 0:58:46.216
I know. I know.

0:59:02.093 --> 0:59:04.004
Rain?

0:59:47.004 --> 0:59:49.211
Run!

0:59:51.008 --> 0:59:56.151
The water! We gotta get out of here!
Come on, this way!

1:00:15.132 --> 1:00:17.203
Come on, Obesey!

1:00:20.971 --> 1:00:23.110
Come on, you can do it!

1:00:23.174 --> 1:00:24.883
I can't.

1:00:24.976 --> 1:00:26.080
Go on without me.

1:00:26.110 --> 1:00:28.991
Hey, you're not the only one here!

1:00:29.079 --> 1:00:31.958
Oh, no!

1:00:32.149 --> 1:00:35.221
Help him! Help us!

1:00:37.121 --> 1:00:38.998
Huh?

1:00:40.057 --> 1:00:41.903
You want help?

1:00:41.993 --> 1:00:43.939
You got it!

1:00:58.175 --> 1:01:00.112
- Ah!
- Thanks, guys!

1:01:00.211 --> 1:01:03.124
There, daylight!

1:01:04.148 --> 1:01:07.186
Come on, Obesey, get it up!
Get it up!

1:01:11.188 --> 1:01:14.965
- This is it!
- Yeah, if Obesey would hurry up.

1:01:15.169 --> 1:01:18.207
- Coming Through! Ah!
- Aah!

1:01:25.981 --> 1:01:27.953
Oh, boy.

1:01:36.150 --> 1:01:40.054
Look, no hands!
Ha-ha-ha!

1:01:57.101 --> 1:01:59.103
There is another way out!

1:01:59.136 --> 1:02:01.047
Stop now, Obesey!

1:02:01.072 --> 1:02:03.052
You can stop!

1:02:03.073 --> 1:02:05.952
Obesey, stop!

1:02:06.977 --> 1:02:08.217
I can't!

1:02:09.013 --> 1:02:10.185
Hey!

1:02:31.168 --> 1:02:36.140
Wow, I think you've found your true calling, Obesey.
You're not a slug, you're a plug.

1:02:37.942 --> 1:02:40.457
I... I suppose I am!

1:02:41.111 --> 1:02:42.954
Oh!

1:02:48.020 --> 1:02:50.342
Obesey, stop!

1:02:50.350 --> 1:02:52.159
- Come on, Obesey!
- Back it up!

1:02:52.189 --> 1:02:55.068
Don't touch me there!

1:02:57.127 --> 1:03:00.108
Not my nostrils, stop!

1:03:03.234 --> 1:03:06.113
Oh, what a rain!

1:03:06.203 --> 1:03:08.149
Oh, no!

1:03:12.009 --> 1:03:14.148
I'm famished.

1:03:14.172 --> 1:03:16.112
Tell me about it.

1:03:16.113 --> 1:03:20.061
So what now, we wait
until food just drops out of the sky?

1:03:21.051 --> 1:03:25.193
- What the?
- Cool! You are a genius, darling!

1:03:25.222 --> 1:03:28.226
Nothing like home delivery, eh?

1:03:30.161 --> 1:03:34.132
Where's your big slug friend
to help you now?

1:03:39.970 --> 1:03:42.041
Oh, there he is.

1:03:45.009 --> 1:03:47.990
- Obesey!
- Stayput!

1:03:48.012 --> 1:03:52.085
- Remember us!
- As heroes!

1:03:56.053 --> 1:03:57.999
No, they're..

1:03:58.022 --> 1:04:00.161
- We have to..
- No, Finny!

1:04:00.257 --> 1:04:02.965
They're gone.

1:04:15.206 --> 1:04:19.111
Come on, Finny. Obesey and Stayput
wouldn't want us to give up.

1:04:19.210 --> 1:04:22.054
We really have to go.

1:05:08.092 --> 1:05:10.038
This is it.

1:05:14.031 --> 1:05:17.103
How much time
do you think we have?

1:05:22.172 --> 1:05:24.118
Not a lot.

1:06:08.218 --> 1:06:10.960
We're alive! Yeah!

1:06:10.988 --> 1:06:14.162
Yeah, but what now?

1:06:24.068 --> 1:06:26.173
Can you see the mountain anywhere?

1:06:26.971 --> 1:06:29.247
No. It's gone.

1:06:31.175 --> 1:06:33.086
We gotta do something, Finny!

1:06:35.112 --> 1:06:37.114
This can't be the end.

1:06:37.147 --> 1:06:39.218
Obesey was right!

1:06:41.252 --> 1:06:44.995
We're not destined to survive.

1:06:45.255 --> 1:06:48.964
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this, Leah.

1:06:48.992 --> 1:06:50.130
Hey.

1:06:50.154 --> 1:06:52.154
It wasn't your fault
that we fell off the ark.

1:06:54.131 --> 1:06:56.111
It was mine.

1:06:56.200 --> 1:07:01.081
I never would have survived this long
if it wasn't for you, Finny.

1:07:02.072 --> 1:07:04.052
You're a real...

1:07:04.208 --> 1:07:06.119
...friend.

1:07:08.145 --> 1:07:11.957
Come on, give me a hug.

1:07:23.090 --> 1:07:26.074
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!

1:07:26.096 --> 1:07:28.943
I told you I was a great hugger.

1:07:29.033 --> 1:07:30.944
Not that!

1:07:30.968 --> 1:07:33.039
The ark!

1:07:36.064 --> 1:07:37.164
We're saved!

1:07:37.174 --> 1:07:38.209
- Hey!
- Over here!

1:07:38.242 --> 1:07:40.019
- Hello!
- Hey!

1:07:40.110 --> 1:07:43.182
- Hey! Hello!
- We're over here!

1:07:45.182 --> 1:07:47.080
There is nothing but water.

1:07:47.090 --> 1:07:50.240
- Hey! We're here!
- I don't think they can see us.

1:07:50.350 --> 1:07:53.064
We gotta do something!

1:07:54.220 --> 1:07:56.285
- Scare me!
- What?

1:07:56.290 --> 1:07:58.973
I said "Scare me"!

1:07:59.096 --> 1:08:01.133
I think we're too late.

1:08:04.201 --> 1:08:06.112
Oh, my!

1:08:06.136 --> 1:08:09.174
- It's Finny!
- Is Leah with him?

1:08:09.206 --> 1:08:11.083
Uh-oh!

1:08:14.211 --> 1:08:16.020
Ouch!

1:08:16.046 --> 1:08:21.120
- I said scare me, not bite me!
- Next time, be more specific.

1:08:25.954 --> 1:08:26.954
It worked!

1:08:27.124 --> 1:08:29.001
She's alive!

1:08:29.025 --> 1:08:31.025
I told you we'd find them.

1:08:32.029 --> 1:08:33.975
Where am I?

1:08:36.954 --> 1:08:38.954
Oh! Look who's awake?

1:08:38.978 --> 1:08:40.978
You!

1:08:43.173 --> 1:08:46.120
- Hold the course.
- Aye-Aye.

1:08:54.051 --> 1:08:55.897
What are they doing?

1:08:55.986 --> 1:08:59.024
Come on, move!

1:09:01.959 --> 1:09:03.131
Come on!

1:09:13.103 --> 1:09:15.242
- Huh?
- Wait a second.

1:09:21.954 --> 1:09:23.954
I'm in charge here!

1:09:32.055 --> 1:09:33.033
Huh?

1:09:33.056 --> 1:09:35.058
Let go on three.

1:09:36.226 --> 1:09:37.204
Three.

1:09:43.954 --> 1:09:45.954
Is that all you got?

1:09:51.041 --> 1:09:53.078
My hair!

1:09:56.079 --> 1:09:59.185
How very dare you!

1:09:59.954 --> 1:10:03.950
looks like I've got to get
my claws dirty, after all?

1:10:12.963 --> 1:10:15.944
You wanna play dirty?

1:10:21.104 --> 1:10:25.075
How's that for dirty?

1:10:29.113 --> 1:10:32.185
- Thank you.
- Let's go!

1:10:32.216 --> 1:10:35.060
- Arks have brakes, right?
- Stop!

1:10:51.954 --> 1:10:53.954
We're safe!

1:10:56.240 --> 1:10:58.242
Finny!

1:11:15.950 --> 1:11:19.954
Thanks! Let's get on the ark.

1:11:21.198 --> 1:11:24.077
What are you waiting for?

1:11:29.006 --> 1:11:30.986
Finny!

1:11:34.857 --> 1:11:35.371
Finny!

1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:38.914
- Leah, take my hand.
- Mom, no!

1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:40.150
Finny!

1:11:40.150 --> 1:11:42.130
I'm never letting you
out of my arms again.

1:11:42.152 --> 1:11:44.962
- You don't understand!
- Where's Finny?

1:11:45.022 --> 1:11:45.992
He fell over board.

1:11:46.089 --> 1:11:48.126
I don't think Finny can swim.

1:11:48.954 --> 1:11:50.954
Neither can I.

1:11:54.131 --> 1:11:56.168
Mom, we have to help them!

1:11:56.192 --> 1:11:58.192
No. I can't lose you again.

1:11:58.235 --> 1:12:01.148
But he's my friend!

1:12:04.041 --> 1:12:07.113
You stay here!

1:12:19.089 --> 1:12:21.069
Finny!

1:12:22.914 --> 1:12:24.057
Finny, please!

1:12:24.057 --> 1:12:26.050
Don't do this to me!

1:12:29.199 --> 1:12:31.042
Finny!

1:12:31.068 --> 1:12:33.241
Finny, no!

1:12:36.173 --> 1:12:39.086
I'm sorry I broke my promise.

1:12:39.109 --> 1:12:43.148
I... I'm so sorry.

1:13:10.974 --> 1:13:13.955
Dad! Dad!

1:13:13.977 --> 1:13:16.981
I can't breathe.

1:13:17.013 --> 1:13:21.052
I know. We're under water.

1:13:21.084 --> 1:13:22.188
You're, you're...

1:13:22.219 --> 1:13:25.063
You're talking!

1:13:25.088 --> 1:13:26.123
You're breathing!

1:13:26.123 --> 1:13:28.160
Ah, you're alive!

1:13:28.191 --> 1:13:30.967
But so are you, Dad!

1:13:30.970 --> 1:13:32.057
I know!

1:13:32.220 --> 1:13:34.171
I know!

1:13:37.134 --> 1:13:39.136
Wow!

1:13:42.105 --> 1:13:45.086
This is great, Dad!

1:13:45.108 --> 1:13:47.088
Wow!

1:13:50.180 --> 1:13:52.160
I don't believe it!

1:13:52.182 --> 1:13:54.961
It all finally makes sense.

1:13:55.051 --> 1:13:59.932
Finny, we've found
our true home: Under water!

1:14:00.257 --> 1:14:04.103
Hey Leah, check me out!

1:14:04.127 --> 1:14:08.974
Oh, no! Watch out! Behind you!

1:14:11.954 --> 1:14:13.954
Leah!

1:14:13.978 --> 1:14:16.478
- You stay here.
- No, dad. I have to...

1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:17.314
Stay!

1:14:19.109 --> 1:14:20.247
- Hey!
- Hmm?

1:14:20.954 --> 1:14:22.954
Leave them alone.

1:14:29.954 --> 1:14:32.554
Come on, Finny! They need air!

1:14:34.954 --> 1:14:36.954
Finny?

1:14:36.978 --> 1:14:38.978
Take care of Leah and her mom.

1:14:39.029 --> 1:14:41.976
- What are you doing?
- I have an idea!

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000
Light attracts enemy.

1:14:44.024 --> 1:14:46.024
Wait!

1:14:49.139 --> 1:14:51.952
- Where are they?
- I don't know!

1:14:52.042 --> 1:14:54.181
Look!

1:14:59.983 --> 1:15:01.557
- Are you okay?
- Thank you.

1:15:01.952 --> 1:15:03.090
Where is Finny?

1:15:03.119 --> 1:15:07.124
He's still down there all alone.
He's doing something stupid.

1:15:10.093 --> 1:15:12.064
Finny!

1:15:12.162 --> 1:15:15.075
Where are you?

1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:40.030
Over there!

1:15:52.135 --> 1:15:54.172
It's pay-back time.

1:15:54.204 --> 1:15:57.151
Nestrian style!

1:16:11.988 --> 1:16:15.162
Finny! Huh?

1:16:15.192 --> 1:16:19.063
- Finny!
- Dad! Help me!

1:16:19.162 --> 1:16:21.108
Hang on!

1:16:35.954 --> 1:16:39.054
Obesey!
Stayput!

1:16:39.078 --> 1:16:41.078
You're back!

1:16:41.954 --> 1:16:43.954
Just in time, for the heroic finale.

1:16:45.055 --> 1:16:48.903
- You know these guys?
- I thought you were dead!

1:16:48.992 --> 1:16:51.996
Dead? I'm not dead.

1:16:52.028 --> 1:16:55.009
I'm a whale.

1:17:02.172 --> 1:17:05.176
Hold onto me, Leah.

1:17:08.211 --> 1:17:12.125
- That's Obesey!
- Present!

1:17:12.148 --> 1:17:16.995
And Stayput!
At your service, ma'am!

1:17:19.089 --> 1:17:21.126
- Finny!
- Hey Leah!

1:17:21.150 --> 1:17:24.150
Obesey, would you mind
giving our friends a lift?

1:17:24.174 --> 1:17:26.174
No problem.

1:17:26.196 --> 1:17:29.143
Full speed ahead!

1:17:42.212 --> 1:17:46.991
You are a real survivor.

1:17:49.052 --> 1:17:51.999
Finny.

1:17:53.954 --> 1:17:56.454
You little Nestrian.

1:17:56.478 --> 1:17:58.478
Huh?

1:17:59.954 --> 1:18:01.954
You saved my daughter's life.

1:18:02.526 --> 1:18:03.926
<i>And mine.</i>

1:18:04.100 --> 1:18:07.138
And consequentially mine as well.

1:18:07.170 --> 1:18:10.117
And mine. Now come here.

1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:14.179
Wow! Grymps are good huggers too.

1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:20.118
I assume you have found your children.

1:18:20.150 --> 1:18:23.188
- We sure did.
- So, once again.

1:18:23.219 --> 1:18:29.934
Mr. and Mrs. Grymp, if you would
finally accompany me to your cabin.

1:18:30.026 --> 1:18:33.007
Cabin? We don't need
cabins anymore.

1:18:33.029 --> 1:18:38.069
Come on, dad! Let's go home!

1:18:39.102 --> 1:18:44.108
I'll see you later.
I'm coming.

1:18:52.954 --> 1:18:55.154
- You missed, buddy.
- I know. I know.

1:18:56.186 --> 1:18:58.063
Nestrians.

1:18:58.088 --> 1:19:00.967
First you want on the ark,
then you want off.

1:19:00.991 --> 1:19:05.133
Why don't you just
make up your tiny little minds?

1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:28.742
Come one, Dad!

1:19:28.986 --> 1:19:33.160
- Look, Isn't that those Nestrians?
- Oh, yeah.

1:19:33.189 --> 1:19:35.999
Finally they found where they belong.

1:19:36.026 --> 1:19:42.136
Yeah, probably we should've told them
at the check-in, don't you think? Hmm?

1:19:49.954 --> 1:19:52.554
- Hey, Leah!
- Go, Finny! Go!

1:20:01.050 --> 1:20:03.189
Left foot, right foot...

1:20:03.219 --> 1:20:08.066
Ah, who needs
feet when you got fins!
